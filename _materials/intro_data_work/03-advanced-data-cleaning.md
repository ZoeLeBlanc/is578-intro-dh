Now that we have merged both our datasets we can finally compare how popular these tools are across the class compared to this dataset. In our original merge sheet `Merged Dataset` we should have the following:

![counts table]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/counts_table.png)


1. Finish finalized merged dataset
2. Start to visualize in Google Sheets
   1. Then do Raw Graphs
3. Then transpose in OpenRefine
4. The import in Google Sheets
5. Sum values
6. Start to visualize in RawGraphs again

Talk about what makes a good data visualization

Give the students the total tool counts and have them create a visualization in Google Sheets and RawGraphs
Reflect on what makes these tools useful or not, difficult or easy to use
