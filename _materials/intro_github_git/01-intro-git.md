<h4 id="github-account">Creating a Github Account</h4>

While we'll be sharing a lot of materials via Canvas and Google Drive, we'll also be doing some sharing and collaborating on Github. Using Github is not mandatory for assignments but it is convenient for some of them, and it's important professionally for you to have an account.

[Github](https://github.com/) is a free platform and is a popular for software development and version control (something we'll discuss on Thursday), and I expect some of you are already familiar with it. We will be discussing some of the politics associated with the platform on Thursday, and I want to note that there are alternatives like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product). Nonetheless, it is also very popular for digital humanities research and as a perhaps crude search option, I would actually recommend taking a look at the number of repositories on Github tagged as `digital-humanities` [https://github.com/topics/digital-humanities](https://github.com/topics/digital-humanities).

We'll be discussing what exactly Github is in class, but you can always check out their PR as well to get a general sense (click on the image to go to their 3 minute intro video).

To create your account, simply [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and create a new username. Once you have your account, **please share your username with the instructor so I can add you to our course repository**. In terms of selecting a username, I would recommend choosing something that you plan to use professionally, unless for some reason you want to keep your activity for the course anonymous (totally your choice!).

GitHub provides additional documentation on [signing up for an account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). You'll be using a [free personal account](https://github.com/pricing) to work with GitHub. Most of our work will be in public repositories, but if you are doing research that you would like to be kept private, you will also be able to set up private repositories under this account.

<h4 id="writing-code">Installing some way of writing code</h4>

In this course, you'll be writing code in a few different programming languages, but we'll primarily be using Python. Given that's the case, you have the option of primarily working in the cloud, through Google Colab [https://research.google.com/colaboratory/](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).

You can read more about Colab here [https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) and it is a popular platform for those needing GPU resources. However, that's likely to be a fairly exceptional likelihood for this class. Nonetheless, you could complete a lot of the homework assignments through this platform, *so I'm letting you choose how you would prefer to work*.

As an alternative, I am hoping that I can help everyone get setup to write code locally (as in on your computer). Setting up a computer to write code can be tedious and frustrating, but it is usually useful and will hopefully help with other courses as well. Also you can still use Colab if you want, even after we get everything running locally!

To work locally, I recommend that you download two things: a code editor and a terminal or console. A code editor is a bit like word processing software specifically for writing code (though you can also just write text in it), and a terminal is a bit like an app for working with files, but instead of clicking on icons, you write commands.

##### Code Editors

![VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/whyvscode/macwinlinux2.png)

For the code editor, I highly recommend that you download and use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You should be able to use the link above to download VS Code for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Another benefit of getting used to VS Code is that you can use it in the browser for any Github repository by changing `.com` to `.dev`. So for example if you took the link to our reposition, `https://github.com/ZoeLeBlanc/is310-computing-humanities` and switched it to `https://github.dev/ZoeLeBlanc/is310-computing-humanities`, you would see the VS Code version of our repository in the browser.
