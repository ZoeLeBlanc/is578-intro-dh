## Seminar and Workshop Framing

*How can and should we work digitally as humanists? How can new technologies transform or interfere with how we work? What are the longer histories of computing in the humanities and how much do we need to understand “computers” in DH?*

*If you are struggling to get through the readings, you may select one of either the "Research as Bricoleur" or "Information Technology and the Humanities Scholar" (along with Milligan chapter) to focus your reading. Remember reading in graduate school is not about memorizing facts but synthesizing and making connections*
