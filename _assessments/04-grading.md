## Consultative or Specifications Grading

As stated earlier, assignments and assigned materials as a graduate student are intended to further your intellectual development, which makes grading both a bit redundant and crude. We are all coming to the course from a variety of backgrounds and life experiences, and with a range of current ongoing commitments, so your intellectual trajectory will naturally look different from someone else's in the course. Rather than paper over this fact we’ll be using a form of grading, called consultative or specifications grading.

In essence, it boils down to you examining the expectations for each grade in our guidelines, determining what you can achieve over the course of the semester, and then throughout the semester using a combination of assessments to decide whether you’ve achieved your goals or not. 

All of this is adapted from my colleague Ryan Cordell, and I’ll be honest that I’m still working through how best to implement this form of grading, so if you have any concerns or questions please don’t hesitate to reach out. I will be sending you periodic surveys so that you can self-assess your weekly participation grade and also your work on your group project.

I’ll be posting more detailed descriptions after our first meeting so that I can tailor the expectations, but the goal here is to encourage you to both take ownership of your learning and also to ensure that you are being graded in a way that is flexible enough given the structure of this course.

Below are the grade contract breakdowns for the weekly participation grades. Grade Contract expectations for the semester-long project will be posted soon as well.

Grades based on contract:

- A+: Achieves Exceeds Expectations consistently across all grade contract categories throughout the semester
- A: Achieves Exceeds Expectations 80% on all grade categories throughout the semester and never Below Expectations
- A-: Achieves Exceeds Expectations 70% on all grade categories and never Below Expectations throughout the semester
- B+: Achieves Exceeds Expectations 50% on all grade categories and only Below Expectations less than 5% of the semester
- B: Achieves Meets Expectations 70% on all grade categories and only Below Expectations less than 10% of the semester
- B- or lower: Has Below Expectations more than 20% of the semester

*Incomplete grades*

An exceptional request for an incomplete grade is most often granted to students encountering a medical emergency or other extraordinary circumstances beyond their control. Students must request an incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor and student will agree on a due date for completion of coursework. The student must submit an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and the student’s academic advisor to the front office: [https://uofi.app.box.com/v/ISIncompleteForm](https://uofi.app.box.com/v/ISIncompleteForm)
