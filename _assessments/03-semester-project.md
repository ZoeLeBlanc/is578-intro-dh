In addition to weekly participation, you will also be responsible for designing, presenting, and documenting a DH workshop. While workshops are not always considered scholarship, they have become one of the hallmarks of DH research and teaching. Depending on your skills and interests, your workshop might be framed around a research question in the humanities, a particular DH methodology or toolkit, or a specific humanities dataset or digital collection. For example, if you are interested in working with medieval manuscripts, you might design a workshop around a particular collection of folios and how one can work with tools to extract data from these manuscripts. Or if you want to work with social media data, you might design a workshop around a particular platform and dataset.

There is no definitive answer of what makes a workshop digital humanities-focused, but you will be expected to share a rationale for why your workshop does count as DH (feel free to use example DH projects and audiences to help explain your choices). I realize that many of you may be unfamiliar with the workshop format. This prompt is incredibly open-ended, which may be disorienting and overwhelming. That’s why you will have the lab workshop sessions and milestones throughout, to help you stay on track (though remember needing to revise or switch directions is often a key part of developing a DH workshop). You are welcome to work individually or in a group, though groups will be expected to produce more extensive workshops (not quite double the work, but more than what one individual could produced). You are also welcome to use tools or data or readings that we have discussed in class, but you are not required to do so. If you do use materials we have discussed in class, you will be expected to engage with them in a new way whether that's building from in class workshops or using new framing, and not simply repeat what we have done in class.


<h2 id="initial-proposal">Workshop Proposal 10%</h2>
<h3>Due Oct 5, 2023 (Extension Possible Until Oct 12, 2023)</h3>

<div class="notice--info">⚡️ More information about developing your workshop is available <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resources/workshop-guidelines/">here</a></div>

The first part of the project is developing a workshop proposal. You should envision this as your pitch for the workshop, and should consider the type of audience and format that would be most compelling for your workshop (whether that’s a humanities department, a DH lab, a digital scholarship unit in a library, or a summer institute, etc…).

Your initial proposal should:

- outline your proposed focus for the workshop and explain what problem this workshop aims to help resolve (what are your initial workshop goals, what are you trying to teach or study, and why this topic?) 
- outline your proposed plan for developing the workshop (do you already know how to use the materials in your workshop or do you still need to learn how? If still learning, what is your plan for starting to experiment? how will you organize the workshop and what is your rationale for your proposed structure? What methods or tools, and datasets or digital objects do you plan to use? If using data, do you have access to it already or do you need to find it or create it?)
- explain your initial goals of this workshop in relation to the readings and topics we have discussed in class (what are the scholarly goals of your workshop and how would you situate it in relation to digital humanities? Who are your audiences and what scholarship does your workshop draw upon?).

The proposal should be no shorter than 3 pages and no longer than 6 pages double spaced, and can contain tables, graphs, bullet points, or any other format that will help you outline the goals and plan for this workshop. Ultimately, this proposal should lay the groundwork for your workshop and will serve as your blueprint for the remainder of the semester.

As you are developing your proposal, I would highly recommend trying to attend at least one of the Savvy Researcher workshops hosted by Mary Ton in the library (calendar is available here [https://uiuc.libcal.com/calendar/savvy?cid=15337&t=g&d=0000-00-00&cal=15337&audience=4666&inc=0](https://uiuc.libcal.com/calendar/savvy?cid=15337&t=g&d=0000-00-00&cal=15337&audience=4666&inc=0)).

<h2 id="workshop-presentation">Workshop Presentation 15%</h2> 
<h3>Due Nov 16, 2023 (Extension Possible Until Nov 23, 2023)</h3>

Once your proposed workshop is approved, you will begin working on it culminating in a “test-run” presentation of your DH workshop. While most DH workshops have audiences, increasingly many are happening remotely without any synchronous audience engagement. Therefore, this presentation will mimic this new reality, and be recorded virtually and shared with your peers in the course, who will then provide feedback and suggestions for your workshop (more on that below). Presentations should be ~20-40 minutes in length (absolutely no longer than 60 minutes), and you are welcome to use any video recording platform. More details will be provided closer to the submission date.

<h2 id="workshop-feedback">Workshop Feedback 5%</h2> 
<h3>Due Nov 30, 2023 (Extension Possible Until Dec 7, 2023)</h3>

Each student will watch at least one workshop once posted, and provide feedback to the presenter via a Google Form. This feedback is intended to help the presenter improve their workshop and should be constructive and respectful. While watching the presentation you should attempt to follow any of the steps and detail your experience completing the workshop.  More details will be provided closer to the submission date.

## Final Workshop Submission 20% 
<h3>Due Dec 18, 2023</h3>

The final piece of your semester-long project is submitting your workshop in written form. This final submission is somewhat based on the structure of a Programming Historian lesson (we will discuss these in class). This final submission is split in two sections: 

- The first half is a written version of your workshop that could be shared publicly with future students or peers interested in the topic.  You may write this section either individually or collectively, and it should be between 5 and 10 pages double spaced. 
- The second section essentially serves as an author's note. It is intended for other instructors and should explain your pedagogical choices, as well as how the workshop aligns with your learning objectives. This section must be written individually and should be between 3 and 6 pages double spaced.

You are welcome to use screenshots or link to recordings. Also, be sure to include citations to the relevant scholarship, both from the course and beyond.

Finally, this final submission must be submitted via GitHub into the appropriate course folder. If you choose, you may also publish it publicly on the course website (More details available closer to submission).
