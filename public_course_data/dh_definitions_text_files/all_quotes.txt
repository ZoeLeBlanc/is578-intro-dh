10	Scott Kleinman 2012-01-01	Previously, I defined DH as an umbrella term for something like the use of technology to study human cultures and the study of the effects of digital technology on human cultures. Today, I would add that DH has (or should have) a self-conscious reflection on the technical aspects of these endeavours, whether that means acquiring and making use of the programming skills to produce new tools for digital study of human culture, examining the methodological problems of using these tools, or theorising the way their underlying technologies affect human society and the material objects of human culture. That said, I am worried that the theorising of the Digital Humanities, the development of infrastructure to support the Digital Humanities, and the opportunity of exploiting the big data sphere of the internet are collectively having the effect of marginalising the study of traditional objects of study in the Humanities, particularly those of the more distant past.

14	dana solomon 2012-01-01	Digital Humanities (DH) is an umbrella term for a variety of practices, methodologies, and forms of scholarship unified by a mutual interest in the humanities and the digital. The Digital Humanities, ever plural, at once denote a social community, a tactical term, a mode of research, and an object of research.
15	Claire Warwick 2012-01-01	If you think you are doing it, then you probably are, but the UCLDH definition is: the application of computational methods to humanities research or to cultural heritage; or of humanities research methods to digital phenomena.
16	Jennifer Guiliano 2012-01-01	At its simplest, DH is the utilization of computers and computational tools for the exploration, analysis, and production of humanistic knowledge.

19	Elena Pierazzo 2012-01-01	As I said on my blog: Digital Humanities is the discipline born from the intersection between humanities scholarship and computational technologies. It aims at investigating how digital methodologies can be used to enhance research in disciplines such a History, Literature, Languages, Art History, Music, Cultural Studies and many others. Digital Humanities holds a very strong practical component as it includes the concrete creation of digital resources for the study of specific disciplines.
20	Katherine D. Harris 2012-01-01	Digital Humanities mean, to me, more now than it did back in 2009 when I first did the Day of DH. DH offers a set of tools to pose humanistic inquiry, but it doesn't necessarily offer definitive answers to those questions. Instead it celebrates and records a process of intellectual pursuit that is then distributed and disseminated to the Humanities community and abroad. Engaging in Digital Humanities is also an ethos: collaboration, building knowledge, sharing projects, screwing around. I apply this to my scholarship as well as my teaching. If my work is better, more complex, because of Digital Humanities, so too will my students' work benefit from the tools, state of mind, and ethos.

23	Ian Thomas 2012-01-01	DH allows, maybe even forces, me to think differently about teaching. It's a community of learners and thinkers who look at tools as ways to make new tools and knowledge.

28	Paul Spence 2012-01-01	I view the Digital Humanities as a constantly changing field, which escapes easy definition - this is has benefits but also presents challenges! Standard definitions talk about the application of information technology to humanities teaching and research - whether that be to develop better ways of doing things or to create new questions and paradigms - but I think that the field also has a key role in articulating how technology is changing scholarship.
29	Natasha Martin 2012-01-01	Digital Humanities is the combination of using digital techniques to better understand and present our understanding of the Humanities. It is about the dissemination of our work, the sharing of knowledge and collaborating to give the best possible chance to a project. Digital Humanities is about the Community, about learning, constantly evolving and being open to new ways of thinking about old questions. It is not, as a friend asked, about building digital humans.
30	Shawn W. Moore 2012-01-01	I would define Digital Humanities as a term used to identify persons, practices, ideologies, etc., that conform to institutional and scholarly values as determined by individual and institutional norms. But I would distinguish the definition of DH from doing digital humanities work (theoretical, practical, critical), which means something much more. Doing digital humanities means challenging the institutionalization of humanistic inquiry; in fact, it means responding to the crippling institutionalization of emotive responses to humanistic practices within the public sphere of all “knowledge workers.” To do this means that we must build tools, technologies, methodologies, and theories that represent this disruptive force, but we must also put what we build into practice. It is not longer enough to present (or represent) an idea, a tool; we must do the work of the community and we must engage the community in developing the ways in which we make our (our as in humanity) work accessible (this means disability studies needs to become a stronger focus of our scholarship and our practices). We must, as Alan Liu argued practice being the service community that we have always wanted to become.
31	Justin Tonra 2012-01-01	I think I said last year that I dislike that question, and that remains the case. Its boundaries are continually shifting and elude satisfactory definition. Even something as simple as 'Using computers for teaching and research in the Humanities' can have caveats. I recognise why a definition of DH might be desirable, but still: I dislike the question.

DH also implies new presentation of data, methods, and results.

54	Robin Davis 2012-01-01	'Digital humanities' is a gathering term for scholars who embrace technology as a means to explore humanities material as data.
55	tesshab 2012-01-01	What it really comes down to is what are people doing to contribute to an understanding of the digital age or what are they doing to expand the practices and work of humanities fields using current technology. A person is not a Digital Humanist by mistake. They are not a Digital Humanist simply because they use a computer to do their work nor are they a Digital Humanist simply by virtue of working in a humanities field and being able to program. What is the methodological framework for their work? For example, using JuXta for collation on a new edition of a novel for the sake of efficiency does not make that edition a DH project, but writing about how the use of JuXta changes the way that we create scholarly editions of literature would fall into the DH field. Essentially, whether or not a person is trying to engage with DH, whether in theory or in practice, determines whether or not they are a Digital Humanist.

63	Anouk Lang 2012-01-01	Digital humanities is a scholarly enterprise which encompasses a field of study, a set of tools, a methodological approach, and a global community, among other things. Digital humanists examine the objects of humanistic study – literature, history, art, language and so forth – using digital tools to carry out the kind of analysis that would be very difficult or impossible to do without the use of technology. Where the value of digital humanities lies, however, is not in the powerful capabilities of the digital tools themselves – as impressive as these may be – but rather in the way that the analyses and visualizations produced by the technology are combined with the skills of critical interpretation, nuanced close analysis, and attentiveness to ambiguity which are born out of a deep grounding in so-called conventional humanities study.
64	Enrico Natale 2012-01-01	I guess I define DH as twofold : Using technology to do Humanities Research and doing Humanities research about Technology. Plus a commitment to the openness of knowledge. Plus a commitment to build new scholarly objects.

70	Trevor Owens 2012-01-01	I have come to think about the digital humanities as an umbrella term for a few different things. These include the development of tools and software for research, teaching, and scholarship. In this case every part of the development process and use of these tools is potentially DH scholarship. I would also include the use of any digital tools and software for interpretation and analysis on humanities research questions. Beyond this I would include any work that involves challenging the traditional roles of scholarship and scholarly communication. For example, using blogs to communicate with broader audiences. Lastly, I would suggest that new media studies, that is studies of born digital objects is inherently a subset of work in the digital humanities. In short, any situation in which the idea of the digital touches or engages with work in the humanities.
71	Martin Holmes 2012-01-01	Humanities
72	Virginia Kuhn 2012-01-01	I define Digital Humanities as that which lies on the continuum that began in orality, and moved through literate or print-based humanities, resulting in contemporary humanistic endeavors. In other words, I don't see it as a break with all that has come before. That said, however, epistemological shifts characterize the digital humanities, distinguishing them from earlier iterations.

76	Douwe Zeldenrust 2012-01-01	In the last 10 years I would have said something along these lines: As an experienced manager and ICT consultant my approach towards DH is practical. For me DH is about interconnecting researchers (and their collections), software developers and infrastructure providers. As a researcher my aim is different. Then DH is about bringing central questions about the nature of the humanities to light. But now I believe Digital Humanities is coming of age. And in my opinion Digital Humanities has become an intrinsic part of the Humanities. Therefore Digital Humanities is the same as the Humanities.
77	Christine McWebb 2012-01-01	To my mind, Digital Humanities is a two-pronged discipline: 1. Digital Humanists study the ways in which new technologies and new media impact on traditional humanities disciplines, on human interaction, society, and communication. 2. Digital Humanists develop tools and resources for humanities students and scholars to further studies in the humanities and the social sciences, but also to allow for new research questions as new data and tools to examine this data become available.

I see the Digital Humanities also as a support network for academics and professionals with a digital component to their work.
85	Pavel Cenkl 2012-01-01	Digital Humanities is a pedagogical and scholarly approach that is both complemented by,'and can exist separately from,'appropriate technological tools.

90	Iris 2012-01-01	The phrase seems to say it for itself,'something related to the humanities going digital. That means anything within the realm of the humanities,'language, history, philosophy, literature, and the arts,'is fair game. In its most basic form, it is still transferring such topics into a digital medium, but more so for the purpose of uncovering or gaining some new information or perspective on the subject being presented. It could come in the form of visually condensing text in order to both give a general idea of the contents and to provide a quicker delivery of knowledge, or by laying out information in some other visual manner so that patterns can be used to quickly pick up on details that provide certain insight into the subject matter.

133	Brendan Cecere 2012-01-01	The best way to describe ‘digital humanities’ is the intersection between human cognition and computing. ‘Human cognition’ can seem like a vague term but it encompasses topics such as art, literature, history, music, theatre, religion, philosophy, etc… Digital humanities could be considered an interdisciplinary topic as any of the aforementioned humanities can be synthesized into a digital form.

161	Brooke Lockwood Lestock 2012-01-01	Though I think 'Digital Humanities' can mean a wide range of things depending on who's defining it, I define it (usually in lowercase) as an area of study that focuses on the intersection of technology and humanistic research. That's the bare bones of it. But really, in practice (or in Praxis, in my case, as in the Praxis Program at UVa - get it?), DH is a wild, carefree romp through the worlds of coding, design, project management, data analysis, and much more, in order to rethink and reappropriate traditional methodologies of humanities scholarship and research.
162	Kimon Keramidas 2012-01-01	While I endorse all the work done under the rubric of Digital Humanities, I am actually not a fan of the term. I feel that the term is used to define a political move within academia that is focused on the privileging of certain technologies and technological approaches over the greater epistemological questions that define the humanities and its constituent disciplines. As someone who has to work with people who may be wary of digital technology in their teaching, research, and publishing practice, I find that insinuating that 'digital humanities' is in some way essentially different from general humanities alienates the unfamiliar and more deeply entrenches the already conservative. I believe that an approach that considers the incorporation of these technologies as part of a continuum in the ongoing impact of technology on academic work that predates the digital and not as a political paradigmatic shift better reminds us that scholarship is centrally focused on the answering of questions about the unknown with whatever tools are at our disposal. The digital shouldn't really matter in the name and we should think about incorporating this approach to scholarship across all work and not a subset of research. The work is good and important, the term I find more problematic and rarely if ever use to define my work or the work we do at my institution.

164	Mark McDayter 2012-01-01	As a rule, I find definitions rather limiting, However, if pressed (as is the case now), I would say that DH is both about the application of digital technologies to research and teaching in the Humanities, and the self-reflexive critical study of those applications.
165	Brian Croxall 2012-01-01	Digital humanities is just one method for conducting humanistic inquiry. Doing research in the humanities often boils down to finding a pattern--in a single text or across several texts--and then providing an interpretation of that pattern. In digital humanities, computation is used to assist in pattern recognition, pulling out patterns that would be difficult for humans to find unassisted. Interpretation of that pattern, however, remains the most important part of the process.

169	Ryan E Simmons 2012-01-01	Digital Humanities is the study of various humanities through the use of computational techniques. The idea is to gather new information that traditional study methods would not easily pinpoint. This new approach can also speed up the process of information retrieval, acting as a supplement to traditional studies and enhancing our overall understanding of the humanities.

172	Elijah Meeks 2012-01-01	Bringing digital tools, objects and techniques to bear on traditional humanities scholarship.
173	Jesse Stommel 2012-01-01	In a recent article on Inside Higher Ed., Steve Kolowich defines 'digital humanities' as 'a branch of scholarship that takes the computational rigor that has long undergirded the sciences and applies it to the study of history, language, art and culture.' To this (and other definitions of digital humanities), I would add that the digital humanities must also consider the interface between digital and analog culture, between the pixels of our computer screens and the printed text of bound books. What we do online has little meaning if it isn't linked (literally or figuratively) to embodied practice. What we are online only exists insofar as it is connected to what we are in the flesh.
174	Lexie 2012-01-01	Digital Humanities, as I have understood it this semester, is the idea or goal in the process of creating something new. I would define Digital Humanities as the idea of integrating and analyzing technical/computational material and create activities with humanistic studies. Basically, it's understanding the material deeper. One activity we did for example this semester was reading the stories of Sherlock Holmes. To understand the story better, with DH we used a tool called the Voyant website. On there, we were able to explore more of the stories depth such as discovering which words are used more than others, also creating charts and graphs and etc.. We were also fortunate to watch the TV series 'Sherlock' to understand the story and actual characters a bit more. Another activity was when reading the novel 'Ms. Dalloway,' which consists of text on paper, with D; we did a mapping project of each of the character's main movements and sightseeing. It made it seem as if we could actually see where they went every day in real life using Google earth. Basically, I would say digital humanities is the process of going further within the research to find that hidden quality that you couldn't see on the surface and create something new with it.

185	johnpwalter 2012-01-01	I define digital humanities as the engagement and practice of the humanities with and through digital technologies. This is far from simple, however. Digital technologies change the way we do work. They change the way we compose and revise even when we are writing for print publication. They also afford us new ways to distribute and publish our work and how we can analyze and manipulate information. More radically, however, digital technologies change the way we organize and perceive the world which leads us to ask new questions and adopt new ideologies. For instance, the rise of open access scholarship, Creative Commons licenses, and remix culture are all breaks from the ideologies of print culture.

It is the study of ways of thinking differently about how we know what we know, and how the interpretive task of the humanist is redefined in these changed conditions' (xii). What resonates with me about Drucker’s definition is how she conceives of DH both in terms of its epistemological function, and in terms of its function for us as critics—and I will add to her definition, as teachers as well.

256	Leif Isaksen 2011-01-01	I see 'Digital Humanities' as an umbrella term for two different but related developments:1) Humanities Computing (the specialist use of computing technology to undertake Humanities research) and 2) the implications for the Humanities of the social revolution created by ubiquitous computing and online access. Since the late Noughties the latter seems to have become the driving force in DH with responsibility for much of the 'boom' in public interest and funding.

This is an attempt to cast a wider net to include social media and the democratization of media production into the literary cannon complete with thoughtful and insightful analysis and scholarly study and reportage. Literature department walls become osmotic membranes and connecting tissue between liberal arts scholarship in academia, art, technology and social media content producers. DH is a conceptual location where good ideas, best practices and innovation is encouraged. Transdisciplinarity is the new DH Norm. DH is a network aggregate university. While individual universities are slow to change, the networked body consisting of DH individuals from many different universities can combine to evolve an educational ecosystem that thrives on change, embraces technology, plurality and open doors, while benefitting from the support of traditional educational organization.

268	Enrico Natale 2011-01-01	I would say there are five branches in the Digital Humanities: 1) Computing in the Humanities 2) History of Computing and Information systems 3) Digital Publishing and Scholarly Communication 4) Digital Archiving 5) Epistemological Thinking about Humanities and the digital Turn.
269	Paul Gooding 2011-01-01	For me, DH is about creating digital toolsets that allow users to undertake new forms of research in the humanities. Just as importantly, it's about making sure we build a deeper understanding of what's changing in the wider world as digital content and interactions become central to our personal and professional endeavours.
270	Mark Fisher 2011-01-01	I do my small part to define it through my work as a humanist--by bringing traditional questions about values, norms, and the role of education to bear on the changing landscape of human expression, communication, and production.

274	Mark Fisher 2011-01-01	I do my small part to define it through my work as a humanist--by bringing traditional questions about values, norms, and the role of education to bear on the changing landscape of human expression, communication, and production.
275	Sebastian Heath 2011-01-01	I don't. But for the time being I do focus on issues of large-scale connectivity between diverse forms of digital scholarship and evidence as mediated through the public availability of both.
276	Mark Tebeau 2011-01-01	I view the digital humanities as a collaborative, open, and emerging field of inquiry. A state of mind, a methodology, and theoretical approach to knowledge, I embrace how it forces us to reconceive our practice. In my own work, I embrace curation, as a means of reweaving and reintegrating theory and practice in history. I seek to interpret space, place, and identity in a multi-sensory way. I fail more often than not. But the digital humanities is like jazz in that it is about process, as well as out outcome.
277	Theodoros Chiotis 2011-01-01	My definition of Digital Humanities is the creative analysis, synthesis and presentation of information (both print and non-print) in digital environment. Digital humanities investigate how digital media affect the disciplines in which they are used. In practice, we are constantly redefining not only the concept of humanities computing but also of computing itself. In this manner, we come to understand how these disciplines when recalibrated for a digital environment contribute to our knowledge of computing; we also come to understand how computing changes the way we acquire knowledge and experience affect.
278	Andy Keenan 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the application of humanities methodologies and theories to modern technology research.
279	Mohamadou Nassourou 2011-01-01	The use of digital technologies to support humanists in their scholarship activities. Moreover humanists are expected to contribute to the perfection of existing digital tools by providing ideas and functional requirements that those tools need to possess.
280	Carlos Monroy 2011-01-01	The use of technology for supporting long term digital preservation of the human record, and enabling innovative methods for accessing it. The creation of digital infrastructure to support the work of researchers and scholars in the humanities. It also involves the development of computing approaches to humanities disciplines, mutually enriching humanities and computer scientists. In my opinion, Nicholas Negroponte, (MIT Media Lab co-founder), eloquently captures the scope of DH by stating: Computing is not about computers anymore. It is about living.

283	Bairbre Walsh 2011-01-01	The Digital Humanities represents an exciting integration of technology and textual culture. There is an increasing need to recognise the culturally productive synthesis represented in the label 'Digital Humanities' and to understand the immense propensity for inclusivity which results from this union. My understanding of the area, though basic and developing, recognises the need for the universal engagement with the positive possibilities for the increased accessibility of information through the Digital Humanities, while also being mindful of the need to preserve the foundations of our humanities.

287	Sharon Cogdill 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the informed and intentional use of digital objects and practices to create and study in the humanities, broadly defined. In that sense, it is a specialization that cuts across disciplinary boundaries to the work of digital humanists in other disciplines. It is also the insistence that the humanities comes to understand the implications of its assumption that only print technologies exist, and it is the insistence that the humanities learns that no technology is invisible, natural, or inevitable, and that someday all humanists will be digital. A few will specialize in print, chirographic or oral-culture humanities.
288	Ed Finn 2011-01-01	I think digital humanities, like social media, is an idea that will increasingly become invisible as new methods and platforms move from being widely used to being ubiquitous. For now, digital humanities defines the overlap between humanities research and digital tools. But the humanities are the study of cultural life, and our cultural life will soon be inextricably bound up with digital media.
289	Peter Haber 2011-01-01	For me, 'DH' is an umbrella term for some recent trends in the humanities: amongst others collaborative working and writing, data driven research and visualization. Very often the current discussions on DH are discussions of delimitations and demarcations. One of the main questions is - imho - if DH should be either an integrated part of the humanities or else be some kind of an auxiliary discipline (in the field of History, in German we have the expression 'Historische Hilfswissenschaften').
290	Lynn Schofield Clark 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities involves the effort to consider how our human capabilities and capacities are developing, or being challenged, by and through digital media.  Those scholars and practitioners who locate themselves within digital humanities view themselves as interdisciplinary collaborators who want to work together to enhance opportunities for individuals and groups traditionally marginalized from the centers of power. We therefore see our task as a critical and productive one, pressing back against the tides of efficiency and busyness that are leading people to view themselves merely as earners and consumers rather than as human creators and participants.
291	Wesley Raabe 2011-01-01	I don't know that defining digital humanities has any useful purpose, though the act of defining marks digital humanities with the attribute of scholarly inquiry. A humanist with an interest in digital things is, I hope, still a humanist, one who defines the self by interest in varieties of human expression. If one's interest is digital things, then one must achieve some form of digital literacy to do useful scholarly things. If one's interest is humanities, one must think about how digital technology reshapes one's interaction with traditional---and new---objects of humanist studies.
292	Alexandra  Guerson 2011-01-01	I would define it as the  intersection between computing technologies and research and teaching in the humanities. Influnced by web technologies, it also promotes collaborative approaches to scholarship.

294	Diane Jakacki 2011-01-01	Creating and applying digital function to humanities research and pedagogy
295	Tanja Välisalo 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities for me is a broad area that contains (1) ICT as a tool for research, teaching and studying and (2) ICT as a subject for humanities research.
296	Maria Engberg 2011-01-01	I let two very different sources define DH for me: A field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. (Wikipedia) and The digital humanities are just the humanities of the present moment. (Alex Reid: http://www.alex-reid.net/). I find those two definitions - one very inclusive and dry, and the other thought-provoking but equally inclusive - to be productive and useful. To work in DH is to be curious about the intersection of digital media and humanities research.
297	Sue Perdue 2011-01-01	Digital humanities is the application of digital tools and processes to the study of humanities disciplines resulting in new efficiencies and new discoveries that are not obtainable in the analog world.

299	Willard McCarty 2011-01-01	I try not to.
300	Jason Heppler 2011-01-01	The advent of digital technologies is changing and challenging the ways historians practice their craft. The way we collect, present, and store information has changed rapidly in the last twenty years. Digital history is several things: a methodology meant to aid the traditional art and practice of historians, the use of digital tools to gain insight into information that cannot be done with a legal pad and pen, allows historians to disseminate and present their information in new ways, and a means to reach wide audiences through digital technologies. The goal isn’t cliometrics 2.0 or to augment the theory-driven social sciences, but to abide by the historian's commitment to complexity and nuance while utilizing digital technologies to aid that task.
301	Philip R. Pib Burns 2011-01-01	Humanities is humanities, digital or not -- the study of literature, fine arts, history, language, and philosophy.  We don't distinguish digital sociology or digital astronomy, so why digital humanities?  Just because computers are involved doesn't mean the basic nature of the subject area is any different than it has been been traditionally.   Computers allow for doing things with texts and other cultural artifacts that could not be done feasibly without the computational power and storage modern computers provide.   Computers should be considered an extension of the scholar's mind -- very useful tools indeed.
302	Jason Farman 2011-01-01	It is both a methodology and a community.
303	Albert D. Ybarra 2011-01-01	I define Digital Humanities as the next evolution of the College of Humanities and Social Science.  The root word of Humanities is human, and encapsulates all of man in an organic or digital realm serves a purpose for historians and other researchers.

305	Matthew Steven Carlos 2011-01-01	A nome de guerre.
306	Vu Thi Phuong Anh 2011-01-01	It is the use of digital technologies to assist people working in the Humanities in ways unimaginable to re-discover the meaning of life (!) in this digital age.
307	Brian Croxall, Emory University, USA 2011-01-01	When I'm asked, I like to say that digital humanities is just one method for doing humanistic inquiry.
308	George H. Williams 2011-01-01	The digital humanities is whatever we make it to be.
309	Matthew K. Gold 2011-01-01	The Digital Humanities is both a field with a discernable set of academic lineages, practices, and methodologies, and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of digital technology to traditional humanistic inquiry. Ultimately, what sets DH apart from many other humanities fields is its methodological commitment to building things as a way of knowing.
310	Brad Brace 2011-01-01	something borrowed, something new...
311	Timothy Welsh 2011-01-01	The digital humanities, quite simply, is doing humanities work with digital media. Though much has been made about digital media, like video games, threatening the kind of book learning that humanists do, many of the same critical problems and questions we have been working on for centuries still apply and can be used to read these new media forms. Furthermore, these digital tools can be leveraged to help us do this kind of intellectual labor. So digital humanities includes both doing humanities on digital objects and using digital objects to do humanities.
312	Alan Bilansky 2011-01-01	DH is all about freedom.  Humanity is the producing animal (Marx) or the symbol-using animal (Kenneth Burke).   The humanities have always studied what people create in the realm of freedom.  The whole point of putting things in the digital realm is the freedom it gives us, to turn the physical into symbols that we can manipulate as freely as in a video game.   You might not find anyone in the academy more concerned with freedom than digital humanists.
313	Elizabeth McAulay 2011-01-01	The use of information technology and software with humanities source materials to pursue research questions.
314	Miles Efron 2011-01-01	Digital humanities work is the activity of joining computation and humanistic thinking to create knowledge--interpretations, motivated collections, reasoned arguments, etc.
315	Eric Forcier 2011-01-01	My idea of DH is that it's sort of like a highway oil slick on a sunny day. When you look at the slick, depending on the angle, you might get a psychedelic kaleidoscope of reflected colours; if you're lucky you might spot your reflection in it; then again, all you might see is darkness. And if you feel compelled to step in it, don't be surprised if you slip.  Those stains will not come out.
316	Allen Riddell 2011-01-01	If someone asks, I refer them to Matthew Kirschenbaum's What is Digital Humanities and What’s it Doing in English Departments? in the ADE Bulletin (2010). That said, I would emphasize the long tradition of humanities computing, going back to Roberto Busa's work at least---although I'm unsure how precisely it relates to the current frenzy of activity.
317	Elli Mylonas 2011-01-01	Digital humanities is the intersection of work in the humanities (research, teaching, writing) with technology (tools, networks, interactions), when the practitioner is consciously exploring a humanistic subject and a technological method, at the same time.
318	Elijah Meeks 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the integration of sophisticated, empirical techniques utilizing tools and technologies typically associated with practical sciences into the study of traditional humanities questions.  It represents a more exploratory and less quantitative approach than social sciences in the use of such tools but it also represents ambitious attempts to model nuanced human wisdom in ways that, like early flying machines, are beautiful, quite impractical and often fail.
319	John Levin 2011-01-01	The application of computing technology to the humanities, *and* the critical investigation of the human use of this technology.
320	Rebecca Davis 2011-01-01	The digital humanities is a name claimed by a community of those interested in digital methodologies and/or content in the humanities.
321	nan 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities means taking full advantage of current and emerging technologies to support conceptualizations of learning history that stress developing inquiry skills, perspective taking and meaning making over the transmission textbook-driven model.
322	Nancy Rubin 2011-01-01	Digital humanities, studies and resources, have the capacity to create social networks. Teachers and curators are able to take collections with them to students in remote locations.
323	James Ginther 2011-01-01	DH combines established research methodologies in the Humanities with computational methods and new ways to disseminate digitally both data sets and research findings.  DH is more a community of practice than a specific set of methods and procedures.  Thus, DH encourages ongoing collaboration and its practitioners are committed to making Humanities research extensible (or at least they ought to be).  DH is by nature interdisciplinary and so provides a practical means to integrate research data and methodologies from more than just one humanities discipline.
324	Dennis Jerz 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the deliberate, critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature, art, philosophy, and language, often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology. We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own digital tools (for example, the forward-thinking digital humanist prefers the open-source tool to the proprietary one). We apply technology because we must participate in digital culture in order to understand it. Full participation in digital culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy, not simply observing (consuming).
325	Alice Hickcox 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the intersection of humanities studies with the digital world. This intersection just keeps getting bigger, as more people do more things digitally, and invent more ways that we can answer questions using computers.
326	Matthew Jockers 2011-01-01	My lawyer advises me not to answer this question. But I have written a few thoughts on my blog. http://www.stanford.edu/~mjockers/cgi-bin/drupal/node/43
327	Richard Cunningham 2011-01-01	DH is a multi-discipline through which criticism, analysis, and speculation is focused on the past, present, and future of the human condition.
328	Erin Costello 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is a term that refers to materiality.  I am a writer and a digital artist which means that ultimately my material is language.  The digital half of digital humanities simply indicates how that language is executed.  Digital Humanities is not an obscure field.  It describes the art of the present by looking at new and familiar modes of representation.
329	Arno Bosse 2011-01-01	Dan Cohen offers a fair definition (http://bit.ly/gVUpV7) with which I wholeheartedly agree. Of course, institutionally, it often makes more sense to describe it as a discipline (when offering a course in DH for example, or in organizing a conference) but I feel that these are rather more like contingent, not essential (if there can be such a thing) characterizations.
330	Larry Swain 2011-01-01	Fairly broadly: the use of technology in communicating, discussing, thinking about the humanities.
331	Dickie Selfe 2011-01-01	The Digital Humanities is not just technology people and not just traditional humanistic scholars. It should include anyone interested in digital pedagogy and scholarship with a humanistic ethic. They might work under the hood, behind the technological screen or out front on the stage making it possible to collect and analyze the changing relationships of all agents involved in determining the human condition in the 21st century.
332	Anastasia Salter 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the acknowledgement that human creativity is, for the moment, deeply entangled with our technological tools and networks. The media extensions cannot be separated from our reality.
333	Aden Nichols 2011-01-01	The democratization of knowledge through the application of digital technologies to the advancement of discourse in the humanities, broadly defined (and not restricted to the academy!).
334	Geoffrey Rockwell 2011-01-01	The use of digital tools and methods in humanities study and dissemination.
335	Andrew Prescott 2011-01-01	The use of digital technologies to formulate innovative reseach questions in the humanities and to investigate in new ways the primary materials (text, image, sound. object) with which humanities scholars are concerned. A field of engagement in which technology, textuality and humanities converge.
336	Adam Crymble 2011-01-01	The digital humanities is a blanket term for many different types of activities. For researchers, I believe it is a philosophy that there are answers to questions that cannot be answered without the aid of machines. For exhibitors, it is a belief that computers can be used to enhance the visitor experience. For all, it is an understanding that while our own minds may have limits, that need not limit what we can do or know.
337	Ethan Watrall 2011-01-01	the application of information, computing, and communication technologies to humanities questions, problems, or data
338	Aaron Gulyas 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the application of digital tools to the work of humanists and the creation of humanist works in the digital realm.  Its applications encompass research and teaching.
339	Miriam Posner 2011-01-01	For me, it's a number of different things. It might be humanistic research that incorporates digital tools, the act of building a digital archive or scholarly edition, finding new ways of displaying research or involving an audience in the research process, or building new tools for humanistic inquiry.
340	Alex Colibri 2011-01-01	DH is the umbrella that shelters critical hackers and theorists of the hack from the vitriol of analog hacks.
341	Anne Welsh 2011-01-01	The application of computing and web-based tools in Humanities research.
342	Benjamin Albritton 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is, increasingly, just Humanities - as far as I'm concerned. New tools lead to new methodologies, new perspectives, and new questions that all humanists should be aware of and concerned with.
343	Jim Ridolfo 2011-01-01	I understand DH as the iterative design and application of digital research and teaching tools to meet the real-world needs of living, breathing humans. This could include students (I'll be working on a pilot digital writing assessment study that day) or cultural stakeholders (I'll also be working on a long-term project involving the design of a digital archive for cultural stakeholders).
344	Debbie Maron 2011-01-01	To borrow someone else's words, it's an intersection of technology and Humanities and uses the brains of people across disciplines. DH subsets (text mining, data mining, mashups) can allow scholarship to flourish in ways we never thought possible by adding quantitative value and allowing traditional scholars to find new patterns in their work which they may have otherwise missed.
345	Tanya Clement 2011-01-01	DH is inquiry enabled by digital methodologies or modes of research, dissemination, design, preservation, and communication that rely on algorithms, software, and or the internet network for processing data.
346	Jade E. Davis 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is what humanities will be in the future.  It is public, dialogical, collaborative and made of collectives.  It allows for remixing and re-imagining how we think and analyze traditional forms of knowledge creation, knowledge sharing and knowledge storage.
347	Meagan Timney 2011-01-01	Using digital technologies and tools to ask questions, do research, hypothesize, and analyse, and present human cultural heritage.
348	Jana Remy 2011-01-01	The study and practice of using technology for humanities-based research, teaching and collaboration.
349	Brian Sarnacki 2011-01-01	At its core, the Digital Humanities is the use of digital tools to gather, organize, analyze, and present scholarly research in the humanities. Humanists seek to understand the world and cultures in which people live and have lived through a variety of disciplines including literature, English and other modern languages, philosophy, art, art history, and history. While many of the questions humanists seek to answer have not changed, new technology, like text mining, dynamic visualizations, and spatial analysis, provide humanists ways to ask new questions and view old questions differently.
350	Kim Lacey 2011-01-01	The Digital Humanities are awesome! We're seeing increased cross-pollination between fields like writing and science, literature and computers, history and engineering. Plus, there are so many new interactive tools that allow us to (re)discover ideas in a new way!
351	Shawn Graham 2011-01-01	Which is to say, I don't know what it is, but I know it when I see it...
352	Paz Tornero 2011-01-01	All disciplines that are used to study human knowledge and culture are known as Humanities. Digital Humanities are all those same subjects conducted by using digital tools to expand human knowledge and culture. To understand how we expand our knowledge and culture though digital tools. As an example, Sociology that is classified within Humanities, if it studies social behavior, relationships and communications between different users on a network, we could talk about Digital Sociology.
353	Claire Ross 2011-01-01	For me Digital Humanities explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history, heritage and culture. DH questions how technology changes the environment around us, physical and digital, and discusses whether those changes are for the better. I believe the concept of digital humanities is much more then just humanities computing; as society becomes increasingly digital, it become a way of life and it is important to understand how and why that is happening.
354	Ernesto Priego 2011-01-01	The scholarly study and use of computers and computer culture to illuminate the human record. (BUSA remix)
355	Daniel Burt 2011-01-01	As mentioned above, to me the key aspects of Digital Humanities are the digitisation of materials, and their dissemination to the general public. Work in this field needs to be outward focussed, as much as it is focussed on the furthering of research. The nature of the digital age is that information can be readily shared, that research can take on a far more collaborative nature, and this approach is of importance to all areas of academic study, including the humanities. Presentation, functionality, and ease of use are, in my opinion, as important as the content of digital archives in all disciplines.
356	Doug Reside 2011-01-01	Innovative uses of digital tools to do the work of the humanities.
357	Tara L Andrews 2011-01-01	I was a computer programmer long before I was a 'professional' humanist; I think in terms of efficient processes and scalable systems. This has interesting results sometimes when I think about historical research.  To me, digital humanities is most usefully defined as the thing humanities can become when we aren't limited by the ability of a lone mind, or even the ability of a group of human minds alone, to detect patterns and analyze evidence.
358	Douwe Zeldenrust 2011-01-01	For me, but this is very specific, Digital Humanities is to interconnect humanities researchers, software developers and infrastructure providers in order to contribute to the research and the research possibilties in this discipline.
359	Michael J Maguire 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is a term used to define the technical evolutionary aspect of modern humanities scholarship. Digital Humanities seeks to take advantage of new modes of technologically enabled scholarship to ensure the contemporaneous relevance and future preservation of classical, traditional and historical modes and approaches of scholarship native to the humanities.
360	Franz Fischer 2011-01-01	Humanities by digital means.
361	Lou Burnard 2011-01-01	With extreme reluctance.
362	Ines Jerele 2011-01-01	Digital libraries are a great example of an outcome of Digital Humanities. The interaction and combination of the new digital era with history, librarianship, literature, etc. gives a wider frame for researchers of all different branches to work in. Now the full texts of important writers are just a click away!
363	nan 2011-01-01	I think that increasingly there is a little of the digital in almost all research in the humanities. This makes Digital Humanities much harder to define but it makes it more relevant than ever. Digital Humanities is technical and it is also highly theoretical. For this reason, as digital technologies help to enhance research in the humanities, the humanities are also helping us to better understand the implications of the digital.
364	Gareth Beale 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is, as far as I am concerned, an opportunity for the Humanities to participate in and help help develop understandings of the spead of digital technologies.
365	Lewis Ulman 2011-01-01	The digital humanities study how digital media (formats and tools) and the cultural forms associated with them affect the work of the humanities -- and vice versa.
366	Matthew Zimmerman 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the application of computer technology to make intellectual inquiries in the humanities that either could not be made using traditional methods or are made significantly faster and easier with computer technology. It can include both using digital tools to make these inquiries or developing these tools for others to use.
367	Jasmine Mulliken 2011-01-01	DH is anything that combines imagining, planning, building, and creating, using a digital medium, with language, literature, history, philosophy, art, music, etc. Anyone comfortable with a computer and interested in the humanities probably participates in Digital Humanities, whether formally (with support from a fellowship or institution, with a planned and mediated project) or informally (through compiling notes and information in multimedia form). We have as much to learn from the informal processes as the formal.
368	Jacqueline Wernimont 2011-01-01	I work in digital literary studies and archives primarily, so I think about digital humanities in terms of the interactions between texts of various sorts and a wide array of digital environments. While my work is focused in this way, I generally conceive of DH as a field interested in the intersections between humanities-based research and teaching and computing technologies and literacies. This would include the humanities which take artistic production as their subject, but also the fine arts and performative practices.
369	Julia Flanders 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is a critical investigation and practice of the methods of humanities research in the digital medium.
370	Vika Zafrin 2011-01-01	Digital humanities is a meta-field, a set of co-evolving new knowledge and best practices expanding from traditional humanities disciplines into born-digital research and teaching methods. Digital humanists study all objects and practices of concern to analog humanities, plus those made possible by the digital age. Digital humanists also build tools that make it possible for themselves, their students and the world at large to engage critically with our cultural heritage.
371	Martin Holmes 2011-01-01	I don't define Digital Humanities any more. All humanities seems to be digital in one way or another.
372	Amanda French 2011-01-01	I don't: I'm sick of trying to define it. When forced to, I'll make the referent the people instead of the ideas or methods -- Digital Humanities is the thing practiced by people who self-identify as Digital Humanists. It's helpful to have a name for the field chiefly for institutional authority. Though granted I think it does involve coding / making / building / doing things with computers, things related to, you know, the humanities.
373	Ernesto Priani 2011-01-01	I like to define Digital Humanities as a set of new activities for humanists instead of a field of study, because Digital Humanities involve something more than a methodology or an interest on a topic. Implies a complete different attitude towards humanities, the understanding, use and creation of new tools, and a alternative way to communicate the findings. This is something that involves you completely.
374	Lik Hang Tsui 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is a way to ask, redefine, and answer questions with a more intelligent set of tools.
375	Claire Menck 2011-01-01	Digital humanities integrates the acquisition of knowledge through research methods, as well as the expression of intellectual material through emergent technologies and media.  This is achieved through technologies (i.e. mobile devices, wireless access, and digitalization), and online platforms (i.e. social media, Web 2.0 applications, and other emergent media).  Together these invite a new epistemological way to know and investigate our world.
376	Alberto Martinez 2011-01-01	The utilization of technologies to help increase the level/types of research, The dissemination of said systems to communities involved in the use of humanities resources, and the study of systems design theories as applied within the realm of humanities.
377	Ali Albarran 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities are the application and the use of computing tecnologies for the research, teaching and investigation in the disciplines of the humanities.
378	Dan Manolescu 2011-01-01	for me Digital Humanities is the filed where the information is delivered in an electronic form to an audience in the humanities field. today the delivery of the information in an electronic form almost has no boundaries. One could easily send a message to one or multiple recipients just from his email account, posting on a blog or simply from his Facebook account (posting a Wall status update). The users around the world are all interconnected together and regardless if one chose to send a message from his yahoo account to an AOL one that is totally possible as now all the separated networks (e.g. AOL, Yahoo) are connected under one umbrella: The Internet. Before, one AOL user was able to send a message just to the members from his network (AOL). Today, the technical developments made possible that everybody could be connected in real time, to anyone else. The information in electronic form can be transmitted not just to those proficient in computing science but also to those interested in modem languages, law, or arts. The capability and easiness of how the digital information can be transmitted/shared/used, not just between and to computing science  related individuals but also to humanities related ones, is the core of the digital humanities field.
379	Chris 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is to me the use and abuse of technology to potential improve study within the field of humanities. It stretches from a simple blog to complex corpus tools to whatever the next person can think of.
380	Orla Murphy 2011-01-01	Digital humanities uses computers, software and the web to enable and publish the ever new work of humanities scholars.
381	Edmond Chang 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is the interaction, interrelation, and intersection of technology, culture, language, and literature.
382	Hugh Cayless 2011-01-01	I think it's a convenient label, but fundamentally, I don't believe in it. There are people who haven't yet attempted to come to grips with how digital tools and methods can change research, teaching, and outreach in the Humanities, and these are those who have. The latter are Digital Humanities types.  But it's all Wissenschaft.
383	David Robey 2011-01-01	Development and application of specialist digital resources for research in the humanities
384	Paul Vetch 2011-01-01	DH fosters the evolution of scholarship, engenders collaboration and dialogue, and widens access and participation across the arts and humanities (and the MLA sector) via the application of digital methods and techniques.
385	Gabriel Bodard 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities is an interdisciplinary area that may include the application of methodologies and research agendas from computer science and other informatics-heavy and quantitative sciences to the subject area of traditional humanities disciplines, such as literature, history and languages.
386	John Theibault 2011-01-01	My definition is an expansive/ecumenical one. I see Digital Humanities as an umbrella concept bringing together all of the different ways in which the computer, and especially the internet, have transformed humanities work. It includes using computer methods to mark and analyze analog humanities products, adapting the distinctive features of the World Wide Web for the production and presentation of humanities research, and bringing humanities methods to the evaluation of the entirely new genres of expression made possible by computers.
387	Scott Kleinman 2011-01-01	I am currently using a short definition, which is that Digital Humanities is a combination of using computer technologies to study human cultures and studying the effect of computer technologies on human cultures.
388	James G.R. Cronin 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities involves the mining of sources, using new media tools, so we can interrogate the past with new questions.
389	Paule Mackrous 2011-01-01	A creative ongoing fest where everybody is invited, but in which only a small bunch of techno people participates!
390	Justin Tonra 2011-01-01	I hate this question, and I don't have an answer for it. Neither, it seems, does a large portion of the people who might be called Digital Humanists. I'll leave it at that.
391	Isabel Galina 2011-01-01	For this project we are going for the broadest definition of Digital Humanities- the interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the impact and relationship of computing and the Humanities. By DH projects we are seeking to document websites, databases, tools, digitilization projects, CDs and so forth that have been created to aid and support humanities research. We are aware that some DH projects can ovelap with digital libraries or teaching aids and digital learning objects.
392	Carlos Fiorentino 2011-01-01	DH mixes computing technologies and new media literacy with traditional fields in humanities, making use of accumulated information. It is a multidisciplinary field, and so very hard to contain within traditional boundaries. Both DH and design are complex playgrounds, maybe that's why designers love to be part of DH projects.
393	Edward Vanhoutte 2011-01-01	The theorizing, developing and application of/on computational techniques to humanities subjects.
394	Dan Cohen 2011-01-01	Broadly construed, digital humanities is the use of digital media and technology to advance the full range of thought and practice in the humanities, from the creation of scholarly resources, to research on those resources, to the communication of results to colleagues and students.
395	Lisa Spiro 2011-01-01	I define digital humanities, loosely, as the use of computers and the Internet to advance research, teaching, and scholarly communication in the humanities, as well the study of computing's significance for the humanities. Many activities would fall under this definition, including building tools and collections, using tools and collections to discern patterns in humanities data, communicating the results of humanities research through multimodal and/or interactive publications, linking together classes using social networking technologies, and analyzing the significance of networked culture. I also define digital humanities by its community and its ethos, which I view as being committed to openness, experimentation, collegiality, transdisciplinarity, public knowledge, and innovation.
396	Segolene Tarte 2011-01-01	The Digital Humanities are  – or should be – a movement in the Humanities that aims to design, develop, promote, and use digital tools to support work – academic or not – in the various disciplines of the Humanities. It strongly encourages, benefits from, and contributes to interdisciplinary practices, including beyond the Humanities. I hope that these practices will soon be so natural to the Humanities that they won’t need to be qualified Digital anymore.
397	Kirstyn Leuner 2011-01-01	I define Digital Humanities as a praxis and also as a field, and in this way it reminds me of Romanticism, also a praxis and a field in my opinion. As a practice, DH involves making and/or thinking about digital objects or entities that participate in or contribute to Humanities disciplines. As a field, it perhaps includes the growing body of electronic literary texts (either e-born or book-born) and archival projects as well as theory and criticism related to digital technologies. I'm sure I'm leaving something out, but this is a start.
398	Elton Barker 2011-01-01	Studying what makes us tick using digital resources
399	Rafael Alvarado 2011-01-01	The digital humanities is what digital humanists do.  What digital humanists do depends largely on academic discipline but also on level of technical expertise.  Each discipline, with varying degrees of intensity, has over the years developed a set of favored methods, tools, and interests that, although shared with other disciplines, remains connected to the discipline.  The task of the digital humanities, as a trans-curricular practice, is to bring these practitioners into communication with each other, and to cultivate a discourse that captures the shared praxis of bringing technologies of representation, computation, and communication to bear on the work of interpretation that defines the humanities.
400	Robert Long 2011-01-01	Humanity (and not just the humanities) mediated through the largest extant body politic. A global vehicle (and personal prosthetic) for containing what it is to be human and humanist--within and without the academy.
401	Matthew Fisher 2011-01-01	Somewhere between a toolset and a mindset, to do DH is to confront the assumptions and implications of the long analog history of the word.
402	Lorna Richardson 2011-01-01	The intersection of humanities and computer technologies
403	Aurélien Berra 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities: A riddle the humanist has to tackle now if he wants to be a contemporary of his own time. — See also: Computer; Conundrum; Humanités numériques.
404	Mike O'Malley 2011-01-01	The practice of the humanities using digital media.
405	Claire Clivaz 2011-01-01	The digital era is being born from the change of the support itself in the Human Sciences thought, with the transformation of our relationship to textuality. This digital turn happens in the context of a crisis in the Human sciences, first a financial crises, but also an institutional and politic one, even if it is softer in Switzerland. In this context, the 'Humanités digitales' – a label diversely interpreted – offer the opportunity to think again our ways of building and transmitting knowledge. The DH are at the same time a practice and a problematic. They include not only the sum total of the digital technologies applied to the Human sciences, but eminently the questioning on the modifications provoked by these technologies, from the point of view of the training et of the knowledge transmission in the Human sciences.
406	Kalani Craig 2011-01-01	The development of new digital methodologies that, combined with traditional humanities methodologies, expands the kinds of research that humanists can do in their own field and in interdisciplinary projects.
407	Roger Whitson 2011-01-01	For me, the digital humanities encompasses teaching and scholarship based around a commitment to building. Building doesn't necessarily mean coding. For me, building means understanding and critically analyzing how artifacts (writing, music, film, even houses, arguments, and groups of people) are put together, with the intention of being able to produce something out of the mass of objects and relations that make up our world.
408	nan 2011-01-01	I think digital humanities is an unfortunate neologism, largely because the humanities itself is a problematic term. The biggest problem is that the tent isn't big enough! I have participated in a number of DH events and they are strikingly similar to things like Science Online.
409	Trevor Owens 2011-01-01	With that said, DH is at its best when it embraces the digital not simply as a means to the traditional ends of scholarship, but when it transforms the nature of what humanists do. The digital allows for scholars, librarians, archivists and curators to engage much more directly with each other and the public. Further, it allows them not simply to write for each other, but to build things for everyone.
410	Sigi Jottkandt 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities to me is any activity that engages computational media to develop and explore ideas relevant to our understanding of literature and culture.
411	Christopher Long 2011-01-01	The performance of humanities related activities in, through and with digital media.
412	Michael Cade-Stewart 2011-01-01	A methodological approach that uses digital tools to pursue research in the humanities, and also study of the field of the digital environment.
413	Alejandro Giacometti 2011-01-01	An obscure association famously made up of isolated people jointly concerned about the materiality of digital surrogates, the virtual qualities of physical relationships between avatars, and the creation of their own simulated utopia.
414	David Beavan 2011-01-01	Digital Humanities, at least for me, is an extension of the root Arts and Humanities disciplines. My experience tells me that computing and technology has led to many new resources and even more answers to research questions. Crucially, it's allowed the researchers I've worked closely with to ask new, previously unimaginable questions. Digital Humanities is a culture, a way of thinking, a new set of methods, and a new set of collaborations.
415	Paul Spence 2010-01-01	Good question, to which there is no good answer, but rather just more questions. My own interpretation is quite broad, but there are two ways of seeing DH which interest me - one is generous and encompasses all work combining humanities research and digital tools and methodology etc, and the other would be rather narrower in definition, reflecting on the specific contribution which 'the digital' can make to humanities scholarship and on the 'new scholarship' which develops as a result.
416	James Cummings 2010-01-01	A field of study that looks at the application of digital technology to the research areas of the humanities.  It is not necessarily undertaking that humanities research, but examining the methodology and provision of possibilities for enabling that research or new conceptions of related research. The majority of work in this area, however, gets characterised by those outside the field as IT professionals just doing a bit of programming work for them while uselessly banging on about long-term preservation formats, open data, and not really doing real research.
417	Michele Pasin 2010-01-01	In a world dominated by digital technology, DH is an attempt to let humanists catch up with the latest computing advances, understand them, criticize them, and eventually be able to determine their evolution 'from the inside'. In terms of a research program, though, DH is still largely undefined. We are still in the 'understanding and criticizing' phase, with only few people moving towards a truly 'creative' phase. We're pulled by the latest technologies developed within the other computing fields, hardly pushing back into these fields our own research results, for they are often perceived as too simplistic, or not generic enough.
418	Dana Solomon 2010-01-01	I define the digital humanities as a methodology and as a field.  I don't see it as the logical telos of the humanities computing tradjectory, but rather as a parallel or sucessive movement. The digital humanities is a beautiful convergence of individuals interested in humanities scholarship, design, born-digital objects, technology and its impact on society, as well as contemporary history and culture.
419	Jentery Sayers 2010-01-01	Digital humanities is the synthesis of technical competencies in computing with critical thinking in fields such as history, literary criticism, cultural studies, textual studies, and information management.
420	William Allen 2010-01-01	A decade ago the humanities comprised academic disciplines that were most easily named by reference to the rules governing the American National Endowment for the Humanities. Digital tools have and are breaking down the distinctions among those disciplines as well as between the traditional 'humanities' and other fields--the arts, for example. Digital tools are encouraging collaborative and open research. Digital tools are forcing us to rethink our definition of academic. Digital tools are re-defining 'scholar.' Digital tools may be pointing the way toward new ways of contemplation and contribution. The digital humanities is both a force for and a record of the ongoing changes.

425	Sophia Hoosein 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities, to me, is the practice of engaging in issues and discussions pertaining to Computing, and applying Humanities-based approaches for examining these issues. Conversely, the same could apply for looking at computing-based issues through a Humanities lens.
426	anna caprarelli 2010-01-01	A new collaborative and social way to analyse, investigate, study and show new research themes related to the Humanities, using not only computer and digital technologies but also the web and all the internet applications available.
427	Ali Grotkowski 2010-01-01	The digital humanities are a diverse area of potential research and inquiry ranging from applying humanities scholarship to computing problems (and vice versa, computing scholarship to humanities problems) to the more cultural and philosophical ideas surrounding our technology influenced world.
428	Brenda M. Trofanenko 2010-01-01	Digital humanities is the utilization of digital technologies and methods that influence how I practice my craft in the humanities. It is directed by the theories about how we engage in various technologies to learn in the humanities. As a historian, I seek to understand how museums and archives engage with digital tools and to understand how individuals utilize such tools to learn about the past.
429	Claire Rosslege 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities is a difficult concept to define; for me DH explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history, heritage and culture. DH questions how technology changes the environment around us, physical and digital, and discusses whether those changes are for the better. I believe the concept of digital humanities is much more then just humanities computing; as society becomes increasingly digital, it become a way of life and it is important to understand how and why that is happening.

435	Jason Boyd 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities involves the use of computers, the internet and related technologies to enable the creation and sharing of humanities scholarship in ways not possible in traditional humanities practice. Digital Humanities challenges traditional understandings of the Humanities by fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and providing new perspectives on the objects of humanistic inquiry.
436	Dennis Jerz 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities is the deliberate, critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature, art, philosophy, and language, often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology. We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own digital tools (for example, the forward-thinking digital humanist prefers the open-source tool to the proprietary one). We apply technology because we must participate in digital culture in order to understand it. Full participation in digital culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy, not simply observing (consuming).
437	Joaquin Rodriguez 2010-01-01	There's no way to divide humanities from its digital basis just as there was no way of separating the humanities from their previous (still alive) analog medium, the paper. We live, write, read, learn, work, digitally, and we create, deliver and use every content digitally as well.
438	Joel C. Yuvienco 2010-01-01	Anything that involves production, sharing and co-creation of experience with digital tools.  May also be called local knowledge management.
439	John Lavagnino 2010-01-01	Using computers to advance scholarship in the humanities.
440	Joyce Yu 2010-01-01	The most concise way that I've defined humanities computing is: a digital component for disciplines in the humanities. Humanities Computing works towards answering 'yes' to questions in the nature of - is this possible? The definition of Digital Humanities can change every day and is something that we're constantly redefining.

442	Malte Rehbein 2010-01-01	Application of computer-based methods for the Humanities. Though, on some occasions, I prefer 'Humanities Computing' to make clearer that these applications often have to be developed and that a lot of basic research is required. What I do not like about the term 'DH' is that it implies that there is digital humanities as opposed to non-digital humanities. But there is not. In the future, computer-based methods will be naturally used by any scholar. It is not like experimental vs. theoretical physics.
443	Laura Mandell 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities is to me really an umbrella term for 1) 'Code Studies' -- the name proposed by Mark Marino; 2) textual encoding and archival curation; 3) public humanities; 4) data mining and visualization; 5) software engineering.
444	Michael J. Maguire 2010-01-01	I define Digital Humanities as the natural evolution or extension of traditional academic humanities pursuits specifically through the use of digital technologies.
445	milena radzikowska 2010-01-01	Digital humanities is an interdisciplinary, often collaborative meeting place where computing addresses the interests and concerns founded in the humanities (and vice versa). At times, digital humanities is highly applied and, at other times, theoretical and reflective, but always diverse and complex.
446	Matthew Jockers 2010-01-01	I think of 'Digital Humanities' is a vague and ambiguous term; in fact, I think it causes a fair amount of confusion both inside and outside of the academy.  DH is an umbrella term that, depending on who you are talking to, covers a huge territory: everything from applied text analysis and corpus stylistics to the more esoteric and theoretical realms of video game criticism.
447	René Audet 2010-01-01	From using computer in another way than a typewriter to large infrastructures for research : I do prefer a large definition to grab all uses of IT linked to literary studies (which is my field). Ideally, it covers literary studies as well as electronic/hypermediatic literature.
448	Silvia Russell, University of Alberta, Canada 2010-01-01	It is the intersection between the humanities and computing science and information technology.  It means using computing technologies in humanities work, or making modern information technology the subject of humanities research, or creating humanities-focused technology. Note that its rarer to find the second definition actually being done, which is really too bad.
449	Stephanie Schlitz 2010-01-01	The Digital Humanities community continues and extends the traditions initiated within and long held by the conventional humanities teaching and research community; but Digital Humanists adopt computational approaches and technologically-driven methodologies to address traditional humanities problems and to research, respond to, and define new types of humanities problems and inquiry.
450	Tim Weyrich 2010-01-01	DH is a research discipline that bridges the gap between engineering and humanities. DH is not simply about engineering software for humanities scholars. Instead, DH is where disciplines from engineering and humanities combine their expertise in dealing with information per se. (And obviously, one potential outcome of such a joint research may be tools that can be used in the humanities.)
451	Stéphane Thibault 2010-01-01	Area studies focused on the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) to research and education in the fields of the Arts and Humanities, and on the development of computing tools to further that research.
452	Thomas Crombez 2010-01-01	Just as man is, according to Nietzsche, 'the animal whose type is not yet determined' ('das noch nicht festgestellte Tier'), digital humanities are those kind of humanities who are as yet undefined. We cannot yet gauge the full impact of digital corpora on the future of scholarly research. We can only speculate what the effects will be of the increasingly digital nature of scholarly publishing. We do not yet grasp the consequences of applying computational methods to 'traditional' disciplines such as History, Literature, and Theatre Studies. My digital humanities are fundamentally a playground for experimentation.
453	Tara L Andrews 2010-01-01	For me, 'digital humanities' is 'humanities amid the digital capabilities we have'.  Most of my programming and scripting is less about consciously defining new digital paradigms for humanities research and much more about 'eradicating the boring and repetitive research tasks, making my life easier thereby'.
454	Lewis Ulman 2010-01-01	Using digital tools to pursue the traditional concerns of the humanities while simultaneously reflecting on and responding to ways that digital tools, media, and culture are transforming those concerns.
455	Amanda Visconti 2010-01-01	Digital humanities, for me, is heavily weighted toward the improvement of resources for researching and understanding literature and history. I see the digital humanities as not only offering tools to offload or streamline traditional research tasks, but as a way to gain new knowledge that was not previously possible by helping learners see new connections and resonances. Paul Conway speaks of digital archives as able to 'transcend originals', and I think of the digital humanities as taking a set of knowledge sources already available and creating something new through them.
456	José Manuel Lucía Megías 2010-01-01	Para mí la Informática Humanística es la disciplina científica que permite acercar los estudios humanísticos a la época actual, utilizando las herramientas, metodologías y medios de difusión nuevo que ha puesto en nuestras manos la informática.
457	Keith Dorwick 2010-01-01	The use of digital technology, including such tools as computers, video cameras and tape recorders at a minimum, to forward the traditional work of the humanities: the creation, storage and dissemination of critical and creative knowledge.
458	Justine Richardson 2010-01-01	To me, the digital humanities are about harnessing digital technologies and tools in the quest for understanding and sharing human expression and experience. At their most fruitful, digital technologies offer both scholars and a public audience new ways of seeing and understanding our cultural heritage  and new ways of discerning patterns that were not possible (or were prohibitively difficult) with human analysis alone.
459	Carlos Ariel Páez Martínez 2010-01-01	It's the coherent and necessary evolution in Humanities research and disclosure. I frankly believe that Digital media is a new tool that can help us expand our possibilities, but it can't and must not replace the traditional methods of gathering and exposing information
460	Paolo Sordi 2010-01-01	I think that DH is a way to approach computer tools and languages from a critical point of view, to study and (try to) provide more structured and semantic digital contents. In a web of data, where contents are produced, shared and redistributed seamlessly trough different supports and devices (and space and time), this is a crucial issue.
461	nan 2011-01-01	I like to define it as injecting a little humanity into the machine. Bad metaphor?  How about: applying the lens of the social sciences to computing science, and using computing methods in humanities research.
462	Eric Forcier 2010-01-01	But really, 'Digital Humanities' just makes me think its practitioners are the first scholars to accept their cyborg-selves.
463	Mitsuyuki Inaba 2010-01-01	I think Digital Humanities is a kind of 'fast-acting glue' that allows scholars with different academic backgrounds to collaborate instantly.

465	Peter Robinson 2010-01-01	I am a non-believer, in this and most things.  Some humanists (very few now) only read and write printed books; some (more and more) read and write only on a computer screen; most of us do both.  Should we have codicological humanists, then?
466	Larry Swain 2010-01-01	Rather broadly:  humanities teaching and research that makes use of computers and even more importantly internet applications as an integral component of either the teaching or the research.
467	John Wall 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities is the use of digital technologies for the pursuit of a greater understanding of the humanities. An example of this would be the use of SQL, which is a database language, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to better understand ecclesiastical sites of Medieval Iceland.
468	Elli Mylonas 2010-01-01	Digital humanities involves the application of the digital to work in the humanities, practiced self consciously. DH encourages the humanist to engage with the technology and not just to consume it. DH is best experienced as both theory and practice.
469	Carl Whithaus 2010-01-01	Studying the impact of digital technologies on the humanities.  Using emerging ICTs to create as well as study digital cultures and the impact of digital technologies on cultures and literacy practices.
470	Neven Jovanovic 2010-01-01	Using computers to see and model what happens when people express themselves and communicate.
471	Susan Greenberg 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities is a new term that describes what is probably an old activity (or collection of activities) but which gives us a fresh image or metaphor for that work, so that it can be seen with new eyes. It allows for new connections to be made across what were previously very separate fields of interest, which is the essence of imagination and the creation of new knowledge.
472	Craig Bellamy 2010-01-01	Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address specific humanities research problems. Distinct from general computing approaches, Humanities Computing is embedded within the research concerns of the disciplines and sub-fields that make up the humanities. The methods employed in the field may be used to uncover new knowledge about corpora or to visualise research data in such a way as to uncover additional insights and meaning. Succinctly Humanities Computing is about structuring, analysing and communicating humanistic knowledge in a critical and authorial way using computing technology.
473	Daniel Paul O'Donnell 2010-01-01	I define it as the use of dataprocessing technology and techniques applied to the development, research, reporting, and teaching of humanities research questions.
474	Geoffrey Rockwell 2010-01-01	The digital humanities is the use of digital methods and technologies in humanities teaching and research. Humanities computing, by contrast, can be reserved for the study and development of those methods and technologies.
475	Susan Hesemeier 2010-01-01	I'll give the same definition from last year: I broadly define Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities as a field in which scholars within the humanities use or study computers or a digital environment (e.g. the WWW, video games, digital fiction, etc.) in their research. I consider myself to be a digital humanities researcher because I am studying digital short fiction and its communities in my thesis, but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires, quantitative/qualitative analysis, etc.), which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of humanities computing.
476	Julia Flanders 2010-01-01	Digital humanities is a field of study characterized by critical analysis of the relationship between the produced surfaces of digital media and the information structures and cultural structures that produce them; alternatively (or additionally) it is characterized by a critical interest in how humanities scholarship is produced, consumed, and transformed in and through digital media.
477	Katherine D. Harris 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities is any attempt to incorporate digital understandings or culture into scholarship, pedagogy and service. For my particular reasons, I define Digital Humanities as an attempt to use computing methods to understand 19th Century British literature from a book historians point of view. As a teacher, I use Digital Humanities to create a bridge among myself, my students and our contemporary culture. We use all kinds of tools to get into 19th Century print culture, and not just tools to assess the 19th Century moment but to also create content that can serve as a critique of our own use of tools, such as Twitter, Moodle, ClassSpot, tech-enhanced teaching facilities. For instance, we explore gaming as a way to discuss the technological upheaval of the printing press in the early 1900s. That's just a tidbit of my world as a Digital Humanist.
478	Melissa Terras 2010-01-01	for me, its the use of computing technologies to allow humanities research that would otherwise prove impossible.
479	Ashton Nichols 2010-01-01	Digital Humanities refers to efforts to link the humanities disciplines with the ever-increasing role of technology in the academy, the scholarly community, and the life of the mind as it is made manifest throughout our evermore global intellectual community. It ranges from undergraduate blogs on energy-savings (sponsored by sustainability initiatives at numerous institutions) to rarified reflections on rhetorical analysis, via word-count searches, of Lord Byron's journals. Digital knowledge-work will define the activity of humanities researchers, scholars, and teachers in the coming decades.  (See also my 2009 definition)
480	Rafael Alvarado 2010-01-01	My definition has changed a bit from last year. I continue to regard the digital humanities as a method, or set of methods, as opposed to a full-blown discipline. I subscribe to Unsworth's claim in 'Knowledge Representation' that digital methods are interpretive frameworks to place alongside others, such as new historicism or deconstruction. But I am more sensitive now to the effects that method has on discipline in the first place, and how the distinction is not entirely stable. I also believe that some curricular space should be devoted to media fluency, just as we devote time to writing.
481	Matthew Bouchard 2010-01-01	I prefer the term Humanities Computing as I think 'Digital' is reductive to the Computing Science portion of the term. My definition for that term is: Any project which combines computing problems with humanities methods, humanities problems with computing methods, or the creation of new objects of study that are somewhere on that continuum.
482	Paul Youngman 2010-01-01	DH is the use of computing technologies to enhance humanities research and the use of humanities methodologies to enhance computing technologies.  It's hallmark is interdisciplinarity.  DH is about recognizing digital technologies as yet another tool to assist in humanities research - not the only tool -  and also about recognizing that the humanities must play a strong role in shaping digital technologies in the future.

485	Sara Steger 2010-01-01	I think the beginning of my course description for Humanities Computing may be a start: In 1924, I. A. Richards began Principles of Literary Criticism by declaring, “a book is a machine to think with.” As the technology of texts has shifted over the ensuing 85 years, our understanding of the book-machine and how we think about/with it has also evolved. In this course, we will explore non-traditional modes of literature (aka “New Media”) along with computational methods for analyzing texts. We will be working with some of the more advanced aspects of XML, XSLT, XHTML and CSS.  Additionally, we will be considering many theoretical works that have an established place in the Digital Humanities canon . . .

487	Willard McCarty 2010-01-01	DH is that which happens digitally in each of the disciplines of the humanities. It is to be distinguished from humanities computing, which is what these separate digital activities have in common and which takes place at some kind of institutional centre, be it physical or notional.

489	William Allen 2009-01-01	An ongoing, active, open action to take or develop tools and content that give all scholars access to materials that they need and to encourage sharing of materials. These materials fall mostly into the areas traditionally associated with the humanities. The very activity of aggressively growing research in an open environment will doubtless change the definitions and limitations that former labels gave to us and our disciplines.
490	Paul Youngman 2009-01-01	Digital Humanities is the marriage of two areas of study heretofore considered incompatible - IT and the humanities.  DH primarily involves the use of IT to gain new insights into the humanities.  The keywords are scale, navigation, and exchange.  These tools afford the humanist the ability to analyze large bodies of work on a previously unimagined scale.  They also allow for ease of research/data navigation and provide an efficient means of research/data exchange.  Secondarily, DH involves an analysis of the humanistic implications of information technology.
491	Stephen Ramsay 2009-01-01	Digital humanities attempts to bring humanistic inquiry and the artifacts of human experience into useful dialogue with digital technology.  It is, at once, a practical and a philosophical endeavor: a matter of building and of theorizing the built.  Practitioners are as likely to be adept at Java as they are post-structuralism; as drawn to the iPhone as they are to Moby Dick; as committed to a kind of optimistic futurism as they are deeply skeptical of a posthuman condition.  Digital humanities is also one of most exciting fields in the humanities today, with a burgeoning community of enthusiasts ranging from undergraduate students to senior scholars.

494	Rudy McDaniel, University of Central Florida 2009-01-01	I define humanities computing as the field of study that helps to provide insight into the human condition through digital technologies.  The methods and techniques used in the digital humanities can be varied: algorithms for emergent art, the application of procedural rhetorics to explore sociocultural issues, or the design and analysis of procedures to make computing technologies more human-friendly.  Research methods related to the digital humanities can be hermeneutic (e.g., what are the hidden cultural and social layers within technological practice, and what do they tell us about particular discourse communities?), ontological (e.g., how do I project my own beliefs, desires, and values onto a personal avatar?), or purely practical (e.g., how can I digitize this text to make it available and searchable to those audiences who do not have the means or ability to access a physical copy?) Humanities computing and the digital humanities are of vital importance as they keep technological systems human-centered, leaving room for creativity, exploration, and playfulness.  The famous interdisciplinary German thinker G. W. Leibniz pursued the dream of the Universal Computer as a means for freeing up the human mind for more creative and enjoyable pursuits; although information overload and the increased workload of distributed industries have made this goal quite challenging, I feel that the field of digital humanities does more to advance this philosophy of creative playfulness and exploration perhaps more than any other area of scholarly study.
495	Rafael Alvarado, Dickinson College 2009-01-01	For me, the digital humanities is not a discipline per se, but a set of beliefs, theories, practices, methods, and artifacts associated with the use of digital technologies to support, extend, and transform traditional humanistic fields.  It cross-cuts the traditional humanities.  I follow Erwin Panofsky's definition of the humanities as those disciplines concerned with interpreting the 'records left by man.'  (Sexism not intended.)  Among the specific items in the assemblage of artifacts and ideas that currently characterize the field are (1) the use XML in a variety of forms, including TEI and serial RDF, to encode texts and data, and (2) the use of mathematical graph theory as a unifying language for describing texts, minds, and societies, and other organis(m|ation)s.
496	Craig Bellamy, King's College London 2009-01-01	Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address specific humanities research problems. Distinct from general computing approaches, Humanities Computing is embedded within the research concerns of the disciplines and sub-fields that make up the humanities. The methods employed in the field may be used to uncover new knowledge about corpora or to visualise research data in such a way as to uncover additional insights and meaning. Succinctly Humanities Computing is about structuring, analysing and communicating humanistic knowledge in a critical and authorial way using computing technology.
497	Amanda Cash, College of Lake County 2009-01-01	Digital Humanities, from my perspective as an educator, has to do with helping students use the skills they have (and are learning) as writers and critical thinkers to compose and critique multi-media works in both academia and their daily lives.
498	Martin Holmes, University of Victoria 2009-01-01	Creating, documenting, deploying and supporting software used in Humanities teaching and research; digitization, archiving and publication of Humanities texts through electronic means; using digital tools to generate and answer research questions related to Humanities texts; collaborating on Humanities projects through digital means; etc. etc...
499	Matthew Steven Carlos, Europäische Universität für Interdisziplinäre Studien 2009-01-01	'Digital' Humanities is a misnomer: there nothing to essentially distinguish it from the disciplines of Arts and Letters as practised for centuries. Just as scientists who utilise grid-computing are not 'digital scientists' but still 'scientists', and fiction authors who publish in hypertext are not 'digital novelists', those working in Arts and Letters who use and generate digital materials and digital tools remain 'humanists'.
500	Kai-Christian Bruhn, University of Applied Sciences Mainz 2009-01-01	Applying spatial information technologies in the field of archaeology is my main subject. But as archaeological data are 'weak', i.e. might have multiple meanings in different contexts, I'm trying to follow up developments in Digital Humanities as a whole. Especially as it is not an established field in German scholarship.
501	Viola Lasmana, San Francisco State University 2009-01-01	For those us invested in literary studies and bibliophilism, digital humanities may seem like a contradictory and terrifying set of terms. Yet, the divide between the humanities and digital technologies seems to be increasingly blurred, thus rendering 'digital humanities' a complementary set of terms rather than a contradiction. Computing within the humanities is to utilize current computer technologies in the pursuit of literary studies. Digital humanities is the conjoining of different areas of disciplines in order to achieve a richer and more collaborative workspace; digital humanities signals the move towards interdisciplinary approaches within academia and the larger culture around us. E-pedagogy, social media classrooms, digital storytelling, blogs, etc. -- these are merely some examples in the current trend towards more interactive, collaborative, and interdisciplinary ways of learning that allows for a blurring of boundaries. Paving the way for dialogues to occur across different disciplines, digital humanities enables a kind of social utopia in which communication happens beyond the classroom, and even on a global scale. If the humanities concerns itself with the human condition and our place within this world (to put it broadly), it is imperative that humanists address the impact of digital technology on their subjects of inquiries. As English professor Cathy Davidson claimed in a 2009 Modern Language Association panel, this is not the age of digital technology: this is the age of humanists, and it is our tasks to forge and claim our positions as important thinkers and players within today's 'digital age.'
502	Robert Whalen, Northern Michigan University 2009-01-01	Digital Humanities: the creation and preservation of extensible digital archives to document, and tools to interact with, material culture.
503	Domenico Fiormonte, Università Roma Tre 2009-01-01	If you ask to an Italian, a Finnish or an American what HC is, would you get the same kind of answer? So my first answer is to start questioning the nature of your question. I think we need to start to apply the principles of ethnographic research to our field. Considering, for example, the existence of strong cultural differences. The universal language of the digital machine gave us the wrong impression that we all share the same values, methodologies, and approaches to the study of cultural objects. It is not so, and in fact I think there is a huge potential cultural danger in our current obsession with standardization. So my second answer would be that humanities computing is a semiotic oxymoron (pessimistic answer), but also a cultural challenge (optimistic option). Sometimes I ask myself: why HC did not do to humanities what cultural studies did to sociology, anthropology, or philosophy? Think of the profound impact that CS had on their intellectual agendas. My answer is that HC lacked an effective and self-confident cultural vision. This happened, in my opinion, beacause HC until now has been mainly focused on the document culture, and consequently has adopted an approach largely dependent on conservative (or if you prefer 'conservation') practices. The 'paradigm of conservation' is largely dominant in the international scenario, led by historically monolingual and monocultural institutions like TEI, which basically tells the community not just how to encode a text, but what a text is. It has been said by other colleagues that HC is the application of computational methods to humanities research and teaching. This definition is correct, but I think that future of HC would be not just to use and apply formal methods, but to challenge existing discourses, cultures and disciplines. So perhaps the issue would be not how much computing we need for getting the answers, but how much the computer science needs us to ask the right questions.
504	Lesley Mary Smith, George Mason University 2009-01-01	For me, Humanities Computing means the transformation of creative and informative communication (for all individuals, not just academics, students and other experts) via an ever- and expanding array of information and communication technologies, an amplification of the individual's power to research, to write, to communicate, to publish and to participate in, and create new spaces in, the public sphere. Just as I feel that the Humanities enrich everyone's life, humanities transformed by ICTs enrich everyone's life.
505	Federico Meschini, De Montfort University 2009-01-01	The best way I've found to describe what Digital Humanities is, in first place to myself, is using a quote from Thomas Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49: 'You know what a miracle is ... another world's intrusion into this one'
506	Susan Hesemeier, University of Toronto 2009-01-01	I broadly define Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities as a field in which scholars within the humanities use or study computers or a digital environment (e.g. the WWW, video games, etc.) in their research.  I consider myself to be a digital humanities researcher because I am studying digital short fiction and its communities in my thesis, but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires, quantitative/qualitative analysis, etc.), which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of humanities computing.  Although I am currently completing a Ph.D. in English, my M.A. in Humanities Computing and Comparative Literature from the University of Alberta has helped me to approach my research from a more interdisciplinary perspective-- something that I see as being an integral part of humanities computing/digital humanities.
507	Julia Flanders, Brown University 2009-01-01	Digital humanities studies the intersection and mutual influence of humanities ideas and digital methods, with the goal of understanding how the use of digital technologies and approaches alters the practice and theory of humanities scholarship. In this sense it is concerned with studying the emergence of scholarly disciplines and communicative practices at a time when those are in flux, under the influence of rapid technological, institutional and cultural change. As a way of identifying digital interests and efforts within traditional humanities fields, the term “digital humanities” also identifies, in a general way, any kind of critical engagement with digital tools and methods in a humanities context. This includes the creation of digital editions and digital text or image collections, and the creation and use of digital tools for the investigation and analysis of humanities research materials.
508	Stan Ruecker, University of Alberta 2009-01-01	I often say that humanities computing involves three distinct research areas. First, some researchers apply computing to research questions in the humanities. These might be questions they've always pursued but can now pursue faster or at a larger scale, or they may be questions that could not be addressed satisfactorily at all without computers. Second, some researchers take computing as an object of study using humanities methods. Examples include cyberculture and posthumanism. Third, some researchers take a generative approach, creating new online materials or tools for subsequent study and use. Most of my own work is in this third area.
509	Jolanda-Pieta van Arnhem, College of Charleston 2009-01-01	Digital Humanities to me encompasses any of a multitude of approaches to the arts and humanities that address and embrace the empowering societal shifts afforded by technology.  Digital Humanities is about open communication, collaboration and expression.  It mirrors my own artistic process of A/R/Tograpy, in that DH incorporates art, research and technology.  It is about discovery and sharing as much as it is about archival and data visualization.  Above all, Digital Humanities is about shedding light on the human experience and ultimately our own interconnectedness.

512	Sharon Webb 2014-01-01	The exercise of defining digital humanities can often leave us with more questions, lingering theories and answers that allude to some aspect of the question but which inevitably lead to assertions that perhaps, digital humanities, is open to interpretation. Essentially, what it is or is not is based on “your” interpretation and perspective as either a practitioner, theorist or an observer. In its simplest guise, digital humanities (from my perspective) is the provision and development of technology for the humanities, which is itself focused on artifactual evidence to theorise and explore human culture, thought and society.

534	Chris Milando 2014-01-01	For me, the easiest way to define DH is not (necessarily) a discipline in-and-of-itself, but a practice: the use of digital tools, software and techniques to enhance scholarship in the humanities. That being said, aside from enhancing traditional modes of scholarship (increasing speed of communication, increasing size and availability of databases, etc.), I think DH also offers unique insights that simply cannot be derived from traditional (analog) methods of research and analysis.
However, what ultimately makes DH unique from the traditional humanities, is its insistence on interdisciplinary collaboration, unique methods of scholarship, and mediums of study that are 'born-digital'.

541	Adam Rabinowitz 2014-01-01	For the Day of DH 2013, I defined Digital Humanities as the use of digital tools to do all of the following: collect richer datasets during our research; document those datasets in such a way that they can be more easily understood and reused by others; use digital datasets to identify patterns that inform us in new ways about our subject matter; and communicate our research and subject knowledge to our students and the general public in innovative, interactive, and engaging ways.
In 2014-01-01 I am less convinced by the idea that what I described above is actually a distinct field of inquiry. Frankly, I think everyone should be doing the things I mentioned -- and most scholars these days are already doing at least the first thing (using digital tools to collect richer datasets). I'm also a bit put off by the title 'Digital Humanist' or the statement 'I do Digital Humanities'. These seem to me increasingly statements meant to define in-groups and out-groups (and, consciously or not, to better position the speaker for funding and promotion opportunities). So this year, I'm a Humanist who works with digital tools. I do Humanities, digitally. So should you.
542	Scott Kleinman 2014-01-01	DH is a cover term for a wide variety of activities that attempt to explore and expand areas of knowledge typically examined in the Humanities by developing and/or applying computational tools or methods in ways best suited for these areas.

Humanities is humanities, digital or not -- the study of literature, fine arts, history, language, and philosophy. We don't distinguish digital sociology or digital astronomy, so why digital humanities? Just because computers are involved doesn't mean the basic nature of the subject area is any different than it has been been traditionally. Computers allow for doing things with texts and other cultural artifacts that could not be done feasibly without the computational power and storage modern computers provide. Computers should be considered an extension of the scholar's mind -- very useful tools indeed.

551	John Walter 2014-01-01	Although I embrace the term digital humanities, I find the need to define digital humanities as something separate from or in addition to the humanities at large to be problematic. Even though the logic of print still shapes and governs aspects of what we do, both as humanists in the academy and our culture at large, electronic media have been shaping us and our culture for more than 100 years now and digital media for decades. The modern humanities, having their origins in the fifteenth century, were intimately tied to the new technology of the printing press: by the new ways of production, transmission, organization, visualization, and thinking that the printing press fostered. As humanists in the digital age, it should be a given for us to fully engage digital technologies and the new methods and apparatuses they foster. Simply put, there should be no need for us to identify ourselves as digital humanists.
But since we do need to do so, I define digital humanities not as doing the work of traditional humanities with digital technologies but as engaging the humanities with the tools available to us and by the logics they foster. We explore, we interpret, and we make. Most importantly, we understand that all technologies of representation and communication bring with them affordances and constraints, and to limit ourselves to the apparatus of one technology, of one technological age, is to limit what we and what the humanities can be.

571	Stewart Varner 2014-01-01	DH is a big and probably over-stuffed box that holds an increasingly disparate menagerie of projects, processes, methods and positions that somehow manage to involve humanistic questions and digital technology (both broadly defined). At its best, it can be the most open-minded and egalitarian place in the humanities. At its worst, it can be, well, frustrating. It is practiced by some of the best folks I know and dismissed by some of the other best folks I know.
572	Zoe Borovsky 2014-01-01	from the UCLA DH website:
'Digital Humanities interprets the cultural and social impact of new media and information technologies—the fundamental components of the new information age—as well as creates and applies these technologies to answer cultural, social, historical, and philological questions, both those traditionally conceived and those only enabled by new technologies.'

574	Bruce Matsunaga 2014-01-01	At its broadest and most concise, I define DH as using digital technology as a lens to examine cultural artifacts.
575	Jill E. Kelly 2014-01-01	Digital humanities is an exciting and emerging discipline bringing together technology and the humanities . But it can be many things beyond: it is a means to enhance scholarship through digital sourcing and computer technologies; a means to design less 'traditional' forms of scholarship; a means of engaging students in lecture, discussion, and technology; to a means to disseminate scholarship to wider audience (particularly important given recent complaints about humanities and the academy); etc. etc.
576	Sarah Melton 2014-01-01	It's a hydra--one could define DH as using digital tools and methods for humanities research, as taking the digital as object of study, as the study of networks and communication. Often with an emphasis on building, making, doing.

So digital humanities do all of that through the tools and methods available in digital technologies. In a real way, the digital changes and transforms culture, too.

598	Jürgen Knauth 2014-01-01	Personally, I don't define DH. Definitions should be done by others than myself. But I have a pretty clear understanding what I think DH is: DH is the 'place' where various disciplines meet, especially informatics and humanities. There are numerous of problems that can only be solved if those expertises are brought together. The project I'm working on - SeNeReKo - is a great example for such co-operation of multiple disciplines.

603	Caitlin Christian-Lamb 2014-01-01	I define Digital Humanities as teaching, research, and projects in the humanities (and other related disciplines) that takes advantage of the affordances of digital tools and computational methods. It's definitely not a perfect definition!

610	Paula Johanson 2014-01-01	I defined DH for my aging parents as 'using computers to improve the ways I study, learn, and write about my research and my experiences, even though I'm a writer, not a rocket scientist.'
611	Aline Stang 2014-01-01	Digital Humanities offer an opportunity to approach conventional material in a specific way to develop and answer new scientific questions.
612	Kristen McCants 2014-01-01	I define the digital humanities as any activity that makes use of uniquely digital methods of analysis, criticism, and data display to open a new window into a particular subject of the humanities. For me, DH offers methods of analyzing and making widely available aspects of the humanities that would not otherwise be available. A digital humanist, then, is not necessarily one who seeks to deliberately engage with a digital interface, but anyone who uses technology to bring new forms of analysis to bear on humanist subjects.
613	Sara Kerr 2014-01-01	DH is where the traditional fields of the humanities meet the technological advances, and increased accessibility, made possible by computers. It enables researchers to combine traditional methods with the processing power of computers.
614	Katie Kaczmarek 2014-01-01	To me, digital humanities is about exploring the ways in which the affordances of technology can help us explore the deeper concerns of the humanities, from expanding archival access to thinking about what it means to read something. DH embodies a spirit of collaboration, experimentation, and play, in which failure is acceptable and part of the normal process, and in which the action of 'making' is as valued as the action of thinking.
615	Andrea Horbinski 2014-01-01	DH is the application of digital and computational methods, often data-intensive, to the traditional concerns of the humanities. These new methodologies and tools are not ends in themselves, but rather means of asking old questions in new ways, identifying new questions, and introducing new questions to the field that can only be asked through collaboration both among individual scholars and between scholars and software applications.

Based on the work I do, DH is the application of digital technologies to traditional data and artefacts in order to make new interactive resources for those who are teaching and learning history.

618	Robert P. Fletcher 2014-01-01	For the developing Digital Humanities group at West Chester University, the Digital Humanities include:
1. Studying technology & the culture of technology. This approach subjects technology to the core skills of critical thinking and ethical responsiveness that define humanistic studies as a discipline. (Technology as Object);
2. Using technology to accomplish one of the key missions within the humanities, e.g. teaching with technology, writing with/as technology, computational methods in textual analysis/stylistics. (Technology as Method);
3. Creative and critical production using digital technologies—XML markup, coding & scripting, web production, & user interaction (Technology as Making).   [In the words of my colleague, Randall Cream]
619	Tessa 2014-01-01	DH is the inevitable future at which we thought to have arrived decades ago. Never quite living up to its own hype and underestimated nonetheless.

622	DH group at FBK 2014-01-01	DH is the field in which Humanities and Information Technologies can interact and support each other. On one side Humanistic competences can help Human Language Technologies to tackle one of the most difficult challenges of the discipline, which is the handling of the semantics of human language texts. On the other side Information Technologies can support research activities where the analysis of texts and images plays a crucial role and that are traditionally qualified as Humanistic (e.g. Historical and Literary Studies; Cultural Heritage).

629	lorna hughes 2014-01-01	'Digital Humanities' is what happens when you bring together digital content, tools and and methods to address humanities research questions.
630	Ian Milligan 2014-01-01	I define the digital humanities as two things. Firstly, I think of it as using new and emerging technologies to enhance our understanding of our humanistic fields of inquiry. For me, as a historian, it is learning new things through technology that we couldn't learn otherwise. Secondly, I think of it as playing and exploring new methods of scholarly communication - i.e. putting history online.
631	Torsten Schaßan 2014-01-01	DH is part of what once was called 'auxillary sciences' in the humanities in the best sense: To know about the theory and methods of carrying out scholarly work in a digital way and in the digital age is prerequisite to all work done.

641	Aila Skitcko 2014-01-01	I define DH as a way of exploring a text on multiple levels in order to allow for an enhanced understanding.
642	Britney 2014-01-01	It's like English... but technological and digital.
643	Elli Mylonas 2014-01-01	It's what I do much of the time? It's both a familiarity with digital methods and the ability to easily use digital tools for scholarship, and to do it responsibly. It's also a critical application of these tools and methods.
644	Kiyonori Nagasaki 2014-01-01	DH is a sort of revolutionary activities with integration of various methods and fields for exploring potential of the humanities through digital technologies.

649	Milena Radzikowska 2014-01-01	The Digital Humanities intersect humanities disciplines with computing technologies. To me, DH is collaborative and interdisciplinary.

652	Sara Humphreys 2014-01-01	That's a tough one. I think Matthew Gold et al defined it very well as did the ubiquitous Hayles. Digital Humanities, for me, brings the humanities to the forefront. Just speaking for my own discipline, English, we bring an ability to read closely and analyze language and its uses. We read texts of all kinds as performing cultural work and, in turn, we suggest or even produce new ways of thinking about those texts. Digital humanities allows us to use a vast set of critical tools to analyze and create ways of being in the digital realm.
653	Brian Croxall 2014-01-01	Digital humanities is the use of computational tools or approaches to find patterns in humanistic production, when those patterns are then used for interpretive purpose.
654	Luciano de Sampaio Soares 2014-01-01	DH, for me at least, is more about the Humanities than about the Digital. While the pervading digital (and online) structure has some part in change, it's from culture - and shock of differing cultures - that such changes are truly born. So, DH is pretty much a way to explore the role played by the digital within a much larger context, as well as an exploration on how to use the same digital to further understand the intricacies of culture.
655	Harlan Kellaway 2014-01-01	DH is the growing set of practices and projects geared around humanities inquiry that strategically involve digital resources.

668	Kyle Roberts 2014-01-01	Digital humanities represents the intersection of humanist questions and concerns with new opportunities for interrogation and interpretation provided by digital applications and platforms. It's a very big umbrella that covers everything from mapping to data-mining, aggregators to online exhibitions. As a public historian, I am especially interested in the way in which the digital humanities allows for expanding the reach of our interpretation, to increase the number of stakeholders in our work through user-generated content, and to make our applications and platforms available to those who might not normally have access.
669	Tim Thompson 2014-01-01	On one level, digital humanities is about applying computational methods to questions and problems that have traditionally interested scholars in the humanities. Computational analysis can make it possible to tease out patterns or relationships that are difficult, or impossible, for humans to detect. The purview of the digital humanities extends beyond methodology, however. It is also about raising new questions and exploring topics such as digital literacy and the cultural impact of new media. Whatever the approach, academic libraries have an important role to play in providing the infrastructure and support that digital humanities projects require in order to be sustainable.

674	David Nelligan 2014-01-01	Incorporating things like text mining, data visualisation, community building and curating online exhibitions and collections, Digital Humanities is the emerging field concerned with how studies of History, Literature, Music, Philosophy, Sociology, Performing Arts and other traditional humanities disciplines are utilising new digital tools.
675	Cole Anderson 2014-01-01	DH, standing for Digital Humanities is a kind of all encompassing term that couples digital tools and processing with the work of the humanities. To me personally DH represents the application of tools and programs to better understand, organize and represent texts.
676	Romeena 2014-01-01	DH is an evolving form of creation that focuses on the point of intersection between traditional humanities topics and looks at them through the lens of the digital.

678	Kayla 2014-01-01	For me, Digital Humanities is very similar to an English class just with a computer component to it.
679	Jessica Bonney 2014-01-01	Digital humanities is the art of human record in digital form and it is the study of that record using digital tools for new insights. observing all digital media, data, and computational analysis as text.
680	Susan Brown 2014-01-01	Digital humanities involve situated and embodied engagement in humanities research and teaching through the development or application of digital technologies, in conjunction with the critical analysis using humanities frameworks and epistemologies of the implications of such activities. These inquiries bleed into considerations of mediation more generally, and of the transformative impacts of the digital turn, particularly of new modes of representation, publication, collaboration, dissemination, networking, and expression, on culture and society.
681	Constance Crompton 2014-01-01	Last year, I simply said 'DH is humanities inquiry using computational methods' but this year I should expand that definition, borrowing from Matt Gold: DH is at the intersection of traditional humanities and computing, and brings the two together through a methodological commitment to making as a way of knowing.
682	Stan Ruecker 2014-01-01	DH includes 3 aspects: using digital materials, tools, and methods in the humanities; developing digital materials, tools, and methods for use in the humanities; and subjecting the digital to humanities study.
683	Tiffany Sostar 2014-01-01	I would define DH as the many different digital engagements, both academic and community-emergent, with humanities-related materials and theories, as well as the digital production of new humanities materials and theories.

701	Jim McGrath 2014-01-01	DH is an umbrella term that refers to scholarship, projects, and teaching methods in the humanities that acknowledge the ways that digital media and online culture have transformed our ways of seeing and interacting with the rest of the world.
702	Alyssa Arbuckle 2014-01-01	For me, DH is the multiple ways that scholarship intersects with computing. This ranges from developing prototypes to engaging in collaborative annotation practices to studying new media trends, and, of course, much more. The most exciting bits (& bytes!) are the unexpected ones.
703	Kimberly Rempel 2014-01-01	Digital humanities is a discipline that promotes hands on experience as an important way of learning. Digital humanists also work towards creating online editions of texts are more accessible, and so that full texts, portions of texts, or a combinations of texts can be analyzed.
704	Roger Whitson 2014-01-01	digital + humanities = digital humanities :)
705	Liz Shayne 2014-01-01	DH, as I would frame it now, is any research work within the disciplines we call 'the humanities' that treats digitally instantiated objects or could not exist (or be conceptualized) without digital tools. The digital in DH is as much about the digital mindset as it is about the mechanisms.
I'm a bit more reticent to define 'the humanities' so please forgive that intentional oversight.

708	Barbara Fister 2014-01-01	Digital Humanities is what we will soon call 'humanities.'
709	Jacqueline Hettel 2014-01-01	To me, DH embodies research, teaching, and scholarship that is primarily focused on the intersection and relationship of the digital and the humanities.
710	Meghan Ferriter 2014-01-01	Digital Humanities is an interdisciplinary, dynamic, and evolving field of inquiry that creates space for exploring human culture through digital methods and technologies. It offers opportunities to answer, augment, and interrogate existing humanities scholarship; constantly asking questions and offering new possibilities.
711	Harrison G. Crerar 2014-01-01	Digital Humanities is how the study of text will remain challenged, bringing new dimensions and dynamics of thought to the world of the written language.
712	Patricia Fumerton 2014-01-01	Digital Humanities is DIGITAL humanities and digital HUMANITIES. That is, it is the productive process wherein the technology cannot properly function without the scholar and vice versa. The result is a new creative method and product

716	Anne Flannery 2014-01-01	For the Newberry, Digital Humanities involves not only thinking through the challenges of integrating digital assets, publications, and resources into the array of materials available to our readers, but also understanding the creative process that goes into the resources and policies of other institutions around the world.
717	Andrew Prescott 2014-01-01	What happens when you start using computers to study humanities subjects.
718	Kathryn Tomasek 2014-01-01	use of digital tools to create web objects of interest to traditionally defined humanities disciplines, including history
719	Rafael Alvarado 2014-01-01	The Digital Humanities is the imagined community of a diaspora of humanists whom, having been displaced by the great neoliberal and technocratic transformation of education, have sought to reclaim the homeland of academia by joining the revolutionary, if ambivalent, power of digital technology to the ancient labors of cultural interpretation, historical consciousness, and aesthetic education.
720	Luciano 2014-01-01	var DH = Multi[disciplinar, cultural] + [Serendipity,fun] + academic research;
721	Katherine O'Flaherty 2014-01-01	I've always liked the Stanford Humanities Center definition of humanities: 'the study of how people process and document the human experience. Since humans have been able, we have used philosophy, literature, religion, art, music, history and language to understand and record our world. . . Knowledge of these records of human experience gives us the opportunity to feel a sense of connection to those who have come before us, as well as to our contemporaries.' I think this works for digital humanities too.
722	Frank Lynam 2014-01-01	The ultimate conundrum...
For me, there are three types of DH practitioner: the researcher who actively uses digital techniques as an integral part of their praxis, the specialist tool user (e.g. GIS specialist) and the DH tool creator. In that context, it's difficult to define DH as it can be radically different depending on the person engaging with it.
Having said all that, in my opinion to be truly at the cutting edge of DH, you need to be thinking philosophically about how digital praxis is fundamentally (if at all) different to its alternative(s).
723	Paul Fyfe 2014-01-01	As our collective attention to and practices in the digital remediation of scholarly materials, methods, and communications.

727	Daniela Schulz 2014-01-01	A state of mind? A new approach? A set of methodologies? An academic subject? – I´m not able to give a proper definition, since it is what people make of it. But at least I think (and hope) the following adjectives apply to DH: inquiring – transparent – reconsidering – collaborative – multidisciplinary – receptive
728	MITHyperStudio 2014-01-01	HyperStudio explores the potential of new media technologies for the enhancement of education and research in the humanities. Our work focuses on questions about the integration of technology into humanities curricula within the broader context of scholarly inquiry and pedagogical practice.
729	Laurie allen 2014-01-01	Reluctantly, DH describes a collection of activities that bring together humanistic and digital approaches to learning, knowing, exploring, sharing, and publishing.
730	Kurt Luther 2014-01-01	For me, DH is using technology to support humanistic inquiry.
731	Kale Greenfield 2014-01-01	Any humanities study that either focuses (self reflexively) on the digitality of its subject, or any field of humanities that's study is enhanced through digital tools and methods.
732	Sarah Harris 2014-01-01	I view DH as an interdisciplinary form of research which integrates digital technology with humanities scholarship. As a librarian, I see opportunities for facilitating the use of technology and data within the diverse work of humanities scholars.
733	Molly Des Jardin 2014-01-01	Humanities research that uses computational methodologies from a variety of fields.
734	Timothy J. Pasch, Ph.D. 2014-01-01	I view DH as digitally-enabled knowledges, techniques and approaches that may, under certain conditions, permit the creation and leveraging of a very particular space. In particular, DH may facilitate possibilities that exist in environments resultant from the convergence of technologies in synergistic, human-centered, and project-based rubrics. Critical understandings related to this paradigm may include disassociation from any one particular tool and/or series of objects, the flexibility to merge and combine tools and conceptual frameworks to fit particular goals and/or participants, and the willingness to blend and combine legacy technologies with techniques not yet created. Throughout- a focus on mixing methodologies as well as tools, approaching DH with a spirit of training, and beginning every project with the pedagogical generosity to teach as well as learn- may serve to catalyze rich creation and the innovation that can result in creative and conceptual breakthroughs.
735	Jason W. Ellis 2014-01-01	21st-century humanities research, teaching, and life.
736	Dawn Taylor 2014-01-01	To me DH is a methodology that allows humanists to expand access to their work, rethink their own scholarship as well as those of others, and create greater collegiality, and consequently greater findings, through collaboration.

740	Monica Boyd 2014-01-01	DH is a tool, a process, and a perspective.
741	Nate Sleeter 2014-01-01	It's the humanities, but it's also digital.

743	Danuta Sierhuis 2014-01-01	Digital Humanities is... (1) the intersection of digital technologies and the humanities; (2) a field that creates new forms of digital research and scholarly output;  (3) a field of study that examines the impact of digital technologies on art, cultural heritage, and memory institutions.
744	Matthew Handelman 2014-01-01	1 = The critical investigation of how digital technologies and media change our lives. 2 = The usage of digital technologies and media to rethink and ask new questions about what makes us human. DH = 1 + 2

747	Patrick Sahle 2014-01-01	DH in a narrower sense is a discipline in its own right. It is a metadiscipline to the humanities. DH in a wider sense regards the digital transformation of the disciplines within the humanities and thus takes place within these disciplines as well.
748	Simon Mahony 2014-01-01	Why define it? Just do it!
749	Sarah M. Rowe 2014-01-01	I define DH by my use of it. As I engage with DH, I am looking for ways to effectively communicate scholarly knowledge with a broader audience; not just as a way of outreach or dissemination, but as laying the foundation for the democratization of knowledge and incorporation of multivocality into scholarly work. Thus, a set of tools for effective engagement.
750	Liza Potts 2014-01-01	Through my research and practice, I define DH as both the use and study of digital technologies.
751	Elaine Callinan 2014-01-01	DH merges the practices, styles and systems from ‘traditional’ humanities fields (e.g. history, philosophy, english, etc.) with the computer programmes/tools (such as data/text mining, data visualisation, etc.) to a) answer research questions; b) challenge existing theories; or c) create new/novel questions not before considered, ultimately to bring a new approach to research.
752	Hugh Cayless 2014-01-01	I mostly try not to, but if pressed, I'd say that DH covers both digital methods applied to the humanities and the application of methods and theories from the humanities to the digital.
753	Tara Copplestone 2014-01-01	Materials relating to heritage which are created or transcribed into a digital media. Includes material which is directly born from the digital platform, but is also surrogate from other analogue forms.

760	Matthew K. Gold 2014-01-01	I stick by my 2011 definition: The Digital Humanities is both an evolving field with a discernable set of academic lineages, practices, and methodologies and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of digital technology to traditional humanistic inquiry. Ultimately, what sets DH apart from many other humanities fields is its methodological commitment to building things as a way of knowing.

763	Brooke Andrade 2014-01-01	Digital humanities is the application of technology to humanities research. The best digital humanities projects contribute something to scholarship that could not have been conveyed as well or at all via traditional publishing such as print monographs and journals. Hopefully the term 'digital humanities' will be dropped as projects that integrate technology become part of the norm.
764	Chris Hables Gray 2014-01-01	I try not to.
765	Laura Michael Brown 2014-01-01	To borrow from Matthew Gold, 'building things as a way of knowing.'

767	Taz Karim 2014-01-01	Technically I am an anthropologist, not a humanist. But I would say to me, Digital Anthropology (if that is even a thing!) is the use of digital methods to study culture and/or the use of anthropological methods to study digital cultures. My favorite part of DH? Data visualization, social media network analysis (Instagram and Twitter) and educational technology.
