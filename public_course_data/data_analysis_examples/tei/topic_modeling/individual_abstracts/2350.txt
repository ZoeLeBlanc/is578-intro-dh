                Scholarly Arguments
                Research labs that call themselves visualisation labs include Kings College Visualisation Lab (
                    http://www.kvl.cch.kcl.ac.uk/dhi.html), Wired! Lab Digital Art History and Visual Culture (http://www.dukewired.org/), AliVE—Applied Laboratory for Interactive Visualization and Embodiment (
                    http://www.cityu.edu.hk/scm/alive/), and the founder of CAVE VR, EVL—Electronic Visualization Laboratory (https://www.evl.uic.edu/). The name also appears in conferences and in journals—for example, the 
                    Journal of Visualization and Computer Animation
                    
                        . Can they all be wrong?
                    
                
                The above labs and journals suggest that visualisation can also be the development of a simulation rather than the depiction of data or a model. These laboratories may produce high-resolution graphical models to represent archaeological data, but they can also produce simulations to test hypotheses. Beat Schwendimann 
                    Schwendimann201017(2010)171756Schwendimann, BeatWhat is the difference between a simulation and a model? [Updated]Proto-Knowledge-Turning disconnected information into knowledge through visualizations20142010unknownhttp://proto-knowledge.blogspot.com.au/2010/12/what-is-difference-between-simulation.html?> explains the distinction succinctly: 
                
                A model is a product (physical or digital) that represents a system of interest. A model is similar to but simpler than the system it represents, while approximating most of the same salient features of the real system as close as possible . . . [while] . . . a simulation is the process of using a model to study the behavior and performance of an actual or theoretical system. . . . While a model aims to be true to the system it represents, a simulation can use a model to explore states that would not be possible in the original system. 
                By creating a simulation rather than a model, we can test hypotheses. So, yes, I am also arguing that games can be considered to be visualisations, of the designer’s mental model of the game world. Games (with examples like 
                    Papers, Please; September 12; and 
                    Space Refugees) are persuasive 
                    and rhetorical simulations.
                
                Earlier definitions don’t appear to understand the persuasive and rhetorical nature of visualisations, perhaps because they wish to use them as value-neutral tools. For example, McCormick et al. 
                    McCormick1987140(1987)14014017McCormick, B., DeFanti, T. &amp; Brown, MVisualization in Scientific ComputingComputer GraphicsComputer Graphics216November 19871987?> defined visualisation as ‘to form a mental image of something incapable of being viewed or not at that moment visible’ . . . (Collins Dictionary) . . . ‘a tool or method for interpreting image data fed into a computer and for generating images from complex multi-dimensional data sets’. This definition invalidates visualisations that predate the large use of data, does not attempt to explain the mental model and process behind the visualisation, and believes visualization must focused on image generation.
                
                 More interestingly, Kosara 
                    Kosara200728(2007)282810Kosara, RobertVisualization Criticism – The Missing Link Between Information Visualization and ArtProceedings of the 11th International Conference on Information Visualisation (IV)631–6362007http://kosara.net/papers/2007/Kosara_IV_2007.pdf2015?> posited three interesting criteria for visualisation: it must be based on (nonvisual) data, produce an image, and the result must be readable and recognizable. He added this interesting subcriteria: ‘In addition to readability, a visualization has to be made with the intent to communicate data three steps: realizing that data is being visualized by the image, understanding what is being visualized, and how the display is to be read’. Unfortunately he also tried to create a simple spectrum ranging from practical visualisations to sublime/artistic visualisations. I believe he has conflated two quite different concepts, at least according to Kantian aesthetics. But he has come closer to a more useful and generic definition: visualisation should reveal the process behind the output.
                
                But where is visualisation as a research tool in its own right? Can’t visualisation actually 
                    create new research questions or at least prove difficult to answer questions? Examples in my field, virtual heritage, include a photo-realistic model which showed colours not actually visible in the ruins of the remaining temple 
                    Chalmers199634(Chalmers and Stoddar, 1996)34345Chalmers, A.Stoddar, S.Higgins, T.Main, P.Lang, J.Photo-Realistic Graphics for Visualising Archaeological Site ReconstructionsImaging the Past: Electronic Imaging and Computer Graphics in Museums and Archaeology 85-93114 British Museum Occasional Paper 114 1996London British Museum Press?>, computer modelling to deduce the astronomical function of ancient Roman obelisks (http://idialab.org/virtual-meridian-of-augustus-presentation-at-the-vaticans-pontifical-academy-of-archeology/), or digital data-driven maps to create historically derived visual descriptions of ancient Roman journeys (
                    http://orbis.stanford.edu/). There have also been more general humanities-orientated papers arguing that visualisation can be reflective and critical 
                    
                    
                    (Dörk et al., 2013; Jessop, 2008; Robichaud and Blevins, 2011). 
                
            
            
                Summary
                Visualization is an extremely significant aspect of digital humanities, and writers such as Burdick et al. 
                    Burdick201218SG2-3(2012)18185Burdick, AnneDrucker, JohannaLunenfeld, PeterPresner, ToddSchnapp, JeffreyA Short Guide to the Digital HumanitiesDigital Humanities2012Cambridge USAMIT Presshttp://jeffreyschnapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/D_H_ShortGuide.pdf?> agree, but we need to improve our understanding and communication of visualisation as being part of the humanities not just now but also historically, before the advent of computer data. 
                    And to recap: historically text has not lived in a hermetically sealed hermeneutic well all by itself. A world with literature but without the arts is intellectually and experientially impoverished. Critical thinking and critical literacy extend beyond the reading and writing of text. Visualization can make scholarly arguments relevant to the humanities. Therefore non-text-based research should figure more prominently in digital humanities readers and monographs.
