            At first, the 
                Peanuts comic of 23 January 1952 seems easy to understand. Charlie Brown and Schroeder, two of Charles M. Schulz’s most familiar characters, talk about the music the latter is playing. Upon looking closer, the visual representation is far more complex than what is expected: Schulz reproduces the opening stanzas of Beethoven’s “Grosse Sonate für das Hammerklavier” (Piano Sonata No.29, Op.106); Schroeder, responding to Charlie Brown’s question about the piece, replies in German; and his speech is rendered in 
                Fraktur; Charlie Brown’s response is a single typographic character; and Schulz signs his name in the final panel in 
                Fraktur. 
            
            How do you train students to see the complications in this strip? One solution would be to have them read Scott McCloud’s accessible classic 
                Understanding Comics, Hilary Chute’s more recent 
                Why Comics?, or the audacious 
                How to Read Nancy by Paul Karasik and Mark Newgarden. But another solution would be to have them read the comics very closely through the act of encoding them and to then quantify their findings. In this presentation, I will discuss recent courses I have taught that have taken a digital humanities approach to Schulz’s corpus. 
            
            
                Peanuts first appeared in October 1950. As a “space-saving strip,” which meant editors could arrange its panels in different ways on the comics page, Schulz’s strip may have appeared destined to be quickly forgotten (Schulz, “An Interview” 316). Instead, he continued drawing strip after strip for the next 50 years. When the final Peanuts strip was published on 13 February 2000 (the morning after Schulz had passed away), he had singlehandedly drawn, inked, and lettered 17,897 strips, resulting in what Robert Thompson called the “longest story ever told by one human being” (qtd. in Boxer). 
                Peanuts influenced not only other comics but culture as a whole, with Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and the others being some of the most recognizable characters on earth. Compared to the strips that preceded Schulz’s, such as 
                The Yellow Kid (1895-1898), 
                Krazy Kat (1913-1944), and 
                Pogo (1948-1975), or those that followed it, including 
                The Far Side (1979-1995) and 
                Calvin and Hobbes (1985-1995), Schulz’s style of both illustration and humor was minimal. But as the preceding paragraph suggests, simplicity does not preclude complexity.
            
            For the last two years, I have taught a semester-long “Research in Digital Humanities” course that focuses on Schulz’s work. While we closely read more than four years worth of strips, we extend our understanding of Schulz’s work through the application of different digital humanities methods. First, we have collectively begun a digital edition of 
                Peanuts, encoding strips according to both TEI and the Comic Book Markup Language (CBML; see Walsh). Encoding strips allows us to precisely record features of strips, including setting, weather, activities the characters are engaged in, and whether the strips are tied to a particular holiday (see Croxall et al., 
                Peanuts Taxonomy). We tag characters who are named in the strip as well as place names, and record speech, sounds, types of speech bubbles, and diegetic text that appears in the strip. Throughout this process, the choices of what we encode are collectively determined by the class (see Croxall et al, 
                Peanuts Encoding Editorial Decisions). We discuss the encoding regularly in class sessions, as precision requires us to look carefully at both the comic and the TEI and CBML guidelines. 
            
            While we slowly build this digital edition, we also use a data set of transcriptions (similar to 
                alt-text) harvested from the 
                GoComics website that gives us the ability to search across all 50 years of the comics’ history. With these two different data sets—one small and precise, the other broad and varied—we then engage in distant reading approaches. The first year of the class was dedicated to determining character co-occurrence within the strips and analyzing the networks among Schulz’s characters (see Fig. 1). The second year found us using stylometry to determine whether the different characters had distinct speaking patterns. In the upcoming semester (Winter 2022), we will consider the bounds of season for both weather and sports. 
            
            In this presentation, I will discuss both our methods of encoding and the results of our quantifications. While drawing on the work of others who have examined comics in the terms of digital humanities (see Whitson and Salter; Dunst et al.), I extend the conversation for the first time into the convergence of comics, DH, and pedagogy.
