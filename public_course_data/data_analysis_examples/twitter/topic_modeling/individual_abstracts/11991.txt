            Historians have since long stressed the political and cultural functions of memory and heritage for societies. The more born-digital data have a past of their own, the more memory has also become a topic of interest for data scientists (Au Yeung and Jatowt 2011, Keegan and Brubaker 2015, Graus et.al. 2018, West and Leskovec 2021). Stringently connected to memory but much less studied in data science is our experience of time (Jatowt et.al. 2015 and Van Eijnatten and Huijnen 2021 being notable exceptions). The influential theory of François Hartog, for example, explains the memory boom from the establishment of a ‘time regime of the present’ at the end of the 1980s (Hartog 2015). Aleida Assmann goes against Hartog’s subsequent assertion that an increasingly shorter present is all we are left with (Assmann 2020, 139). Instead, she puts forward her notion of cultural memory to replace ideas of temporal ruptures with a model that ‘emphasizes the ineluctable entanglement of [past, present and future]’ (Assmann 2020, 195-6). 
            Departing from this theory, this study proposes a computational approach to study the relation between the present and the past in twentieth century newspapers by analysing trends in phrases of the format ‘n years ago’. Obviously, there is a plethora of ways in language can evoke the past. However, there are two arguments that justify singling out ‘n years ago’. First, ‘n years ago’ is, as an expression, ubiquitous and syntactically stable in Dutch newspaper language throughout the studied period of the twentieth century. Second, unlike explicit references to years, events or persons in the past, ‘n years ago’ intricately ties the past to the present. The phrase presents the past—and keeps it present—
                as something useful for the present. This notion of ‘useful past’ or ‘present past’ (Paul 2015, 25-27) forms part of Assmann’s critique of Hartog’s theory of temporal orders. 
            
            
                Questions and method
                The questions that are at the center of this study are how trends in references to present pasts relate to named philosophies of time experience, but also which past remains present and how these trends change over time. It takes newspapers as data, because of the vital role they as the ‘first rough draft of history’ have played in memory culture throughout the twentieth century. This study is based on the digitized versions of the most important nation-wide and regional newspapers the Dutch National Library holds and has made available.

                     The preliminary results presented here are based on the example of the national newspaper Telegraaf (1893-1989) of 10,000 documents (articles and advertisements) per year.
                    
                        
                            For the final paper, these titles will be complemented with other available newspaper titles with similar century-spanning scopes. Subsequently, all results will be aggregated to come to an encompassing picture of the present past in Dutch newspapers by means of references to ‘n years ago’. The Telegraaf was chosen as an example here, because it shows trends that are paradigmatic for most other newspapers.
                        
                     These documents have been rid of duplicates and cleaned with the help of Python’s NLTK package.

                            . Cleaning in this script is mostly restricted to the removal of punctuation and caps. Stop words are not removed to guarantee that the Dutch word for the English indefinite article ‘a’ (‘een’), which is part of any standard stop word list, remains part of the data. Similarly, the removal of numbers is no part of preprocessing to allow for phrases like ’10 years ago’(even though Dutch linguistic convention formally does not allow for numbers in running text).
                        
                    
                
            
            
                Analysis and results
                The analysis is done with Python scripts in Jupyter Notebooks and consists of three subsequent steps: 
                The first step is the extraction of a list of the most common trigrams ending with ‘year(s) ago’
                    
                        
                             The Dutch equivalent of ‘year(s) ago’ is for both one and more years written in the singular form ‘jaar geleden’.
                        
                     from the cleaned and sampled dataset. This list is sorted by decade and by frequency to get an idea of the years that newspapers most often use in the phrase ‘n years ago’ throughout the twentieth century. This indicates that single digit years (one – nine) make up the most common phrases of ‘n years ago’, along with decades (ten, twenty, etc.) and one hundred.

                In a second step, the most common references of ‘n years ago’ are plotted, relative to one another, over time. Figures 1-3 show the trajectories of all single years together (figure 1), of all decades from ten to one hundred (figure 2) and of the single years one, ten, one hundred and two hundred (figure 3). These figures show that Dutch newspapers started to look back in time by the use of the phrase ‘n years ago’ since the 1930s. Once they did, the use of some variations of this phrase strongly gained traction, particularly in reference to the near past (one to ten years ago). 
                The final step of the analysis is to look at the actual years that the phrase ‘n years ago’ referred to throughout the twentieth century. Do newspapers tend to look back at specific years, as in the end of the Second World War being ‘five years ago’ in 1950? Or are ‘notable’ years submerged in what is here called ‘everyday memory culture’? The latter seems to be the case if these years are calculated for ‘n years ago’, where n stands for the years from one to twenty and decades from twenty to two hundred. Figure 5 shows that ‘n years ago’ tends to evoke the recent past itself above any particular year. No single year really stands out.
                    
                         Given the nature of this method, the decline in the frequency of years after 1975 that Figure 5 shows is as necessary as it is meaningless. There is, after all, increasingly less data (that ends in 1989) on which these numbers can be based. 
                    
                
            
            
                Conclusion
                In the light of Hartog’s theory of an all-encompassing present, one would have expected a steady decrease of references to the past and the future. This study shows the opposite and substantiates Assmann’s contention that interest for the past returns, particularly in the second half of the twentieth century, in the form of memory culture. With the growing popularity of the studied phrase, Dutch newspapers became mediators of a form of memory culture than can be seen as ‘latent’ or ‘everyday’ in that it emphasizes recurring events rather than returning to a specific thing in the past. This is, particularly, true for the phrases ‘two years ago’ and ‘four years ago’ (Figure 4), the spikes in the diagrams of which indicate references to important sport (Olympics, European and World Championship soccer) and political events (national parliamentary elections).
                The use of the phrase ‘n years ago’ is by no means the only, nor the most important manifestation of memory culture. This limits the explanatory power of this study. In contrast with official and cultivated forms of memory culture, however, it does shed light on the latent, almost oblique, everyday invocation of the past that forms just as much part of that culture.
