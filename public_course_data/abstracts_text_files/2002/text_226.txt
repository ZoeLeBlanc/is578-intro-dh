                    Introduction
                    Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) left a manuscript material that covers approximately
                        20.000 pages. All of these manuscripts are now being prepared for
                        publishing. For the drama texts there are prompt copies; parts; printer's
                        copies; final fair copies; copies of printed editions revised by hand and
                        used as printer's copy for the next edition; drafts that range from ideas
                        for the whole play on a piece of paper to complete fair copies that have
                        been revised so thoroughly that they can no longer be considered to be fair
                        copies. Then there are drafts and fair copies of the poems, and finally
                        Ibsen's letters.
                    Our situation is surely not unique. Projects that are publishing the complete
                        writings of a modern writer are sure to encounter the same range of
                        manuscripts, and will also, when using the TEI
                            Guidelines, encounter phenomena in the manuscripts that are not
                        covered by chapter 18 "Transcription of Primary Sources". The Guidelines state that their "recommendations are not
                        intended to meet every transcriptional circumstance likely to be faced by
                        any scholar" (quoted from the introduction to chapter 18). Still we would
                        find it useful if the Guidelines did include
                        recommendations for some of these transcriptional circumstances, or if a
                        documentation of best practise was included. For this reason we would like
                        to present the problems we have encountered and the solutions we have chosen
                        in the encoding of Ibsen's manuscripts for Emperor and
                            Galilean (1873). We feel that it is appropriate and useful to
                        present the whole process of encoding a complex manuscript, and the
                        questions this process has raised. 
                
                
                    The manuscripts for «Emperor and Galilean»
                    The planning and writing of Emperor and Galilean
                        took almost ten years. The play was published in 1873, and consists of two
                        dramas, both with five acts; the first edition covers 512 pages. The content
                        of the drama is the life of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. Though
                        later not thought to be one of Ibsen's best plays, Ibsen himself considered
                            Emperor and Galilean to be his most important
                        work.
                    There are six manuscripts for Emperor and Galilean.
                        Four of these (NBO Ms. 8to 1937a, NBO Ms. 8to 1937b, NBO Ms. 8to 1937c, NBO
                        Ms. 8to 2821:14) are small fragments containing drafts and notes. These are
                        all at the National Library in Oslo. Then there is the printer's copy (Kgl.
                        Bibl. Kbh. Collin 262, 4to, II, 3), which is at the Royal Library in
                        Copenhagen. The last one, also at the National Library in Oslo, and the one
                        we would like to present here, is NBO Ms. 4to 1111.
                    NBO Ms. 4to 1111 consists of notes, drafts and unfinished fair copies, bound
                        by the library in one large volume of about 700 pages. Smaller notes and
                        fragments have been placed first in the volume, larger drafts and temporary
                        fair copies have been placed at the end. This organization is new, and has
                        probably been done during the binding. Earlier it has been ordered
                        differently; a red pagination (supposedly done by a librarian) is sign of
                        this earlier order. In the volume the red pagination is no longer in its
                        original order. Ibsen himself has left us few clues as to how the material
                        should be organized; there are few dates and only some parts are paginated.
                        We do not consider the current organization of the manuscript as final,
                        since the volume has been made after Ibsen's own time. Our first task is
                        thus to organize the manuscript according to our project's principles. We
                        have decided on chronology/genesis, where this is possible to decide. When
                        we have no direct clues in the material as to what belongs where we will
                        have to make qualified guesses based on content analysis.
                    The next question is the question of typology. This is important for
                        searchability and for the possibilities of organizing the electronic
                        edition. As said, NBO Ms. 4to 1111 consists of a number of different types
                        of manuscripts. There are two sides to this. First we have to decide how
                        detailed the typology should be. Secondly we have to find appropriate terms
                        for the types of material in the manuscript (cfr. facsimile below). There is
                        not yet a fixed typology in this area. Scholars are not always using terms
                        like notes, drafts, fair copies etc. in the same manner. This we think holds
                        for both Norwegian and international scholars. The TEI
                            Guidelines keep themselves out of this discussion (for obvious
                        reasons) and leave the question of typology to their users. Our project has
                        developed a typology that fits the Ibsen material. This typology might be of
                        interest to others as well. (The facsimile below contains a working
                        manuscript with drafts of speeches, and notes in prose.)

                        &lt;text&gt;

                        &lt;sp who="JULIAN"&gt;
                        
                        &lt;spOpener&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;Pr. J.&lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;/spOpener&gt;
                        
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;
                        
                        ...
                        
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                        &lt;lb/&gt;&lt;figure type="bar"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
                        
                        &lt;div type="notes"&gt;
                        
                        &lt;div type="act" n="1-4"&gt;
                        
                        &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                        &lt;/body&gt;
                        
                        &lt;/text&gt;
                        
                        &lt;text&gt;...&lt;/text&gt;
                        
                        &lt;/group&gt;
                    Then there is the question of the basic encoding of this material. We have
                        decided on a structure of groups of texts (cfr. the TEI
                            Guidelines 7.3). We also use unnumbered &lt;div&gt;
                        elements rather than numbered ones since we have found the same types of
                        texts on different levels (cfr. the TEI Guidelines
                        7.1.3). At the more detailed level of the encoding, we will have to consider
                        for instance what encoding is appropriate for text fragments that later turn
                        up as parts of speeches. How should these be encoded, as speeches or prose?
                        They usually lack speakers and stage directions. To what extent should we
                        link these fragments to their later use in speeches?
                    It will be possible to link the manuscript material both internally and
                        externally (to the rest of the text witnesses to Emperor
                            and Galilean), and it will also be possible to organize the
                        material according to other principles than ours. As shown in the encoded
                        example above we supply the outer &lt;div&gt; level
                        (type="workingManuscript/notes") with a type attribute holding the
                        appropriate value for the text type. The inner &lt;div&gt; level
                        (type="act") contains type and n attributes. The value in the n attribute
                        records which part of the drama and which act (within this part) the text
                        belongs to. The type attribute records which textual level (e.g. "act") this
                        piece of text belongs to. With this information we can for example
                        reorganize the material according to text type or according to the
                        chronology of the first print. We can also present comparisons of manuscript
                        and e.g. the first print through linking.
                    In addition to the questions mentioned above, there are a few minor problems
                        to solve. First, some of the bits and pieces of the manuscript are
                        unfinished; the text ends in the middle of a sentence. We will of course
                        check that the missing parts really are missing, and put them in the correct
                        place if they are located somewhere else in the manuscript. Secondly, we
                        have encountered what is for us a new phenomenon. There are a few lists
                        (cfr. facsimile below) in this manuscript, listing either sources (with page
                        numbers) that Ibsen has read and then used in his writing, or listing
                        themes/scenes (also with page numbers) that he wants to include. As he has
                        checked his list he has crossed out (some, but not all of) the items. How
                        should we record this? These deletions seem not to be standard manuscript
                        deletions, yet we consider using the &lt;del&gt; element with the
                        rend and type attributes to record the rendition and the unusual purpose of
                        the overstrike.
                    
                    &lt;del type="checkList" rend="overstrike"&gt;...&lt;/del&gt;
                    The manuscript also includes graphics, illustrations (cfr. facsimile below)
                        and calculations (this manuscript reveals that Ibsen among other things
                        invested some of his money in train stocks, cfr. facsimile below). There is
                        also writing upside down on some pages (cfr. facsimile below). So far we
                        have decided that upside-down writing and calculations should be recorded in
                        the appropriate part of the &lt;teiHeader&gt;. Graphics and
                        illustrations are encoded as usual as &lt;figure&gt;.
                    This is work-in-progress which hopefully by summer 2002 will be well on the
