                    Introduction
                    This paper illustrates how humanists' XML documents from around the web can
                        be shared and integrated using careful schema design and simple XSLT
                        programs.
                    In the web publishing world, resource sharing and syndication are all the
                        rage. [1] The latest RSS specification, composed in RDF, is
                            documented at , and a portion of the
                            O'Reilly network is devoted to the topic. Using XML-based methods
                        like the RDF Site Summary (RSS) or Channel Definition Format (CDF), sites
                        can reuse and share their headlines and stories across the web.
                        oreillynet.com's Meerkat is an impressive example of the power of this technology.
                    Computerists in the humanities have applied less effort to syndication and
                        document sharing, but as scholarly markup begins to describe realms of
                        knowledge such as archaeology [Schloen] Schloen,
                            J. David. "Archaeological Data Models and Web Publication Using XML".
                                Computers and the Humanities 35.
                        2001., anthropology , geography or history, whose content is impossible to confine, and
                        as XML namspaces
                        make it possible to blend and reuse documents one within another [Bosak] Bosak, John. "XML
                            Ubiquity and the Scholarly Community". Computers and
                                the Humanities 33. 1999., it is clear that we need to
                        build into our markup endeavours the means of integrating resources from
                        around the web.
                    As briefly illustrated in a paper at ACH/ALLC 2001, this has been a facet of the research of
                        the Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (Heml) from its inception two years
                        ago. Heml aims to provide the means to coordinate historical information on
                        the web though a markup language that describes historical events and
                        through transformations of conforming documents into historical maps,
                        timelines and tables. After defining its markup language in XML schemas
                        (version 2001
                            07 02) and producing conforming documents outlining Roman
                        Republican history, Heml has turns its attention to exploring the problems
                        and opportunities offered by a semantic web of disparate documents across
                        the web [Berners-Lee] Berners-Lee, Tim. "The
                            Semantic Web". Scientific American. May,
                        2000.. Two conclusions have been drawn from this work: first, rich
                        scholarly markup like Heml has requirements in content integration that are
                        more complex than the problems which the current syndication techniques aim
                        to solve; and that, secondly, these requirements can be met using simple and
                        ubiquitous computational tools.
                    
                
                
                    The Difficulties of Content Integration
                    The more complex content integration requirements of Heml and similar schemes
                        can be illustrated with the example of collecting recipes. Syndication
                        schemes in common use today gather XML content like recipes in a file-box:
                        documents or links are placed alongside each other creating a larger
                        document seriatim. However, as illustrated in
                        Figure 1, this process fails to recognize the overlapping identities between
                        documents of richly marked-up content: the id
                        attributes flour and apples appear twice, confusing matters and possibly causing the
                        document to no longer be valid. 
                    
                        Figure 1. Gathering Documents Seriatim
                    
                    Figure 2 illustrates the preferred outcome. This process gathers the recipes
                        as they are in a cookbook, where ingredients are identified properly with
                        each other and so would, for instance, appear only once in an index.
                    
                        Figure 2. Integrating Content
                    
                    Content integration of Heml documents has to be of the second, more complex
                        sort because its schema is built largely upon the identification of entities
                        through id and idref attributes. In brief, Heml markup comprises a series of event
                        elements; each of these includes information about participants, chronology,
                        locations, keywords and supporting documents. Example 1 is a Heml fragment
                        that identifies the location `Rome.' Once defined in this way, subsequent
                        references to this same location within the document use an XML reference
                        element , thus: &lt;LocationRef idref="Rome"&gt;.
                    These corresponding 
                            Concept
                         and 
                            ConceptRef
                         elements are a design feature of Heml markup: no elements are
                        defined with names ending in the string Ref,
                        except those that have idrefs which are meant
                        to refer to elements with the corresponding name.
                    
                        Example 1. heml:Location element
                         &lt;Location id="Rome"&gt; 
                            &lt;LocationLabelSet&gt;
                            &lt;Label xml:lang="en"&gt;Rome&lt;/Label&gt;
                            &lt;Label xml:lang="la"&gt;Roma&lt;/Label&gt;
                            &lt;Label xml:lang="el"&gt;&#8172;&#8061;&#956;&#951;&lt;/Label&gt;
                            &lt;/LocationLabelSet&gt; 
                            &lt;Latitude&gt;
                            &lt;GeographicalHourLatitude&gt;41&lt;/GeographicalHourLatitude&gt;
                            &lt;GeographicalMinute&gt;49&lt;/GeographicalMinute&gt;
                            &lt;GeographicalSecond&gt;2&lt;/GeographicalSecond&gt;
                            &lt;/Latitude&gt; 
                            &lt;Longitude&gt;
                            &lt;GeographicalHourLongitude&gt;12&lt;/GeographicalHourLongitude&gt;
                            &lt;GeographicalMinute&gt;19&lt;/GeographicalMinute&gt;
                            &lt;GeographicalSecond&gt;8&lt;/GeographicalSecond&gt;
                            &lt;/Longitude&gt; &lt;/Location&gt;
                    
                
                
                    Design Goals
                    There are many ways to approach the problem of integrating such materials;
                        some approaches have the virtue of not requiring metadata at all. The
                        following design goals dictated the Heml project's solution:
                            1. Each constituent document and the resulting integrated document
                                should be intelligible and valid.
                            2. It should be possible to refer to constituent documents through
                                URLs.
                            3. A third party (that is, someone who is not the creator of any
                                of the documents and has no influence in their design) should be
                                able to integrate documents as satisfactorily as their authors.
                            4. The integrating code should be as portable as possible, ideally
                                running on clients or servers.
                            5. The integration process should be recursive so that its results
                                can be the input of a further integration process.
                        
                
                
                    Solution
                    The Heml projects has fulfilled these goals through a metadata file and an
                        algorithm implemented in the XSLT XML document transformation language. The meta-documents that
                        control this process have been named 'Jackdaw' documents, since like their
                        namesakes they gather and put to use disparate materials. [2]
                            A schema has not been prepared for the Jackdaw documents because they
                            are still experimental. I imagine eventually generalizing the concept
                            and expressing it in RDF Example 2 is a jackdaw file that controls the integration
                        of documents relating to the history of Rome down to 201 BCE. Reading from
                        the bottom of the document up, the &lt;filelist&gt; element collects URLs that refer to
                        documents whose content this Jackdaw integrates. Further up, &lt;IdEquivalence&gt; elements identify a
                            &lt;Master&gt; element document
                        with one or more &lt;Duplicate&gt;
                        document elements. In our example the element identified as 'Rome' in the
                            second punic war.xml document is listed as
                        the master of similarly named elements in the other two.
                    The XSLT code that operates on the Jackdaws can be obtained[3] This URL corresponds to the directory
                            path of the file; if the XSLT code is reorganized, the URL will fail. In
                            that case, follow links from the Heml homepage to the CVS viewer and the getDocument XSLT file. on the Heml CVS server. Though
                        the Heml project presently organizes its XSLT transformations using the
                        server-side Cocoon2 engine
                        from the Apache group, advanced web browsers -- Microsoft Explorer 5.5 and
                        greater and most builds of Mozilla 0.9.5 and greater -- perform XSLT
                        transformations on documents that include the proper XML processing
                        instruction tags.
                    The integrating algorithm is simple and based on the assumption that document
                        URLs are unique and that ids are always unique within their document. A
                        function that concatenates an input id with its
                        document's URL is therefore also assumed to be unique in the integrated
                        output document.
                     The integrating algorithm blindly copies all &lt;Event&gt; elements and their children from every
                        document addressed in the &lt;file&gt;
                        elements, except that it generates new id or idref attributes based on the
                        URL and id of the old ones. Furthermore, if an idref points to an element
                        whose id is among those listed in as an &lt;IdEquivalence&gt;&lt;Duplicate&gt;, the new id of the corresponding &lt;IdEquivalence&gt;&lt;Master&gt; is output instead. If an
                        id is among those listed as an &lt;IdEquivalence&gt;&lt;Duplicate&gt;, the XSLT generates the appropriate
                            
                            ConceptRef
                         element and gives it the idref attribute generated from the
                            corresponding&lt;IdEquivalence&gt;&lt;Master&gt;.

                    This process is reasonably speedy. As a functioning example for this paper I
                        ran the jackdaw file in Example 2 using Apache's Xalan 2.0 XSLT engine on a
                        Celeron 400-class machine running RedHat Linux 7.2 and the IBM 1.3-8.0 Java2 SDK. With all caching switched off, it took
                        under ten seconds to gather the resulting 35k document; and three of these
                        seconds appear to be overhead required just to start the java processes. (
                            xsltproc, an XSLT engine written in C,
                        completes the same task in 1.7 seconds!) Network access seems to be the
                        limiting factor for these reasonably small files.
                    Of course, the resulting integrated XML document is usually invisible to the
                        user, who navigates one or more further transformations of that document
                        into HTML or images. Among the transformations available for Heml documents
                        is a dynamic SVG map. (A browser plugin, available from Adobe for Windows
                        and Macintosh, is required to view this image.) Passing the cursor over a
                        dot on the map will bring up the name of the location and a list of events
                        that took place at that location. It can be seen that the lists for Rome and
                        Carthage include events from all periods, as instructed in the Jackdaw file
                        in Example 2.
