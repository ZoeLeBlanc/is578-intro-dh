                    This panel will present some of the work being done at the Centre for
                        Technology and the Arts, De Montfort University, (CTA) and by Scholarly
                        Digital Editions (SDE), Leicester. The CTA specializes in the application of
                        advanced computing methods to the making of scholarly editions, and is best
                        known for the Canterbury Tales Project, often cited as the most advanced
                        instance in the world of the use of computing in exploration and publication
                        of large textual traditions. SDE has developed from the need to find an
                        appropriate vehicle for publishing the work of the Canterbury Tales Project
                        and similar ventures. SDE now maintains and develops two key pieces of
                        software used in this work: the Collate software, used in the transcription
                        and collation of many witnesses, and the Anastasia electronic publishing
                        software, developed specifically for publication of complex scholarly
                        materials in electronic form.
                    This panel will offer three papers covering different aspects of the work of
                        the CTA and of SDE. It will introduce the tools, methods, and principles
                        underlying some of the editorial projects in which the CTA and SDE are
                        currently involved. It will focus on two of these projects: the Canterbury
                        Tales Project, led by the CTA, and the electronic edition of the Greek New
                        Testament in the Nestle-Aland 28th edition now being prepared by the
                        Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart and the Institut fÃ¼r
                        Neutestamentliche Textforschung, MÃ¼nster, and for which SDE is providing
                        software and consultancy services. Reference will be made to other work on
                        which the CTA and SDE is collaborating, notably the electronic edition of
                        Dante's Commedia to be published by the Italian publisher SISMEL. The papers
                        will cover both the practical and theoretical aspects of this work, with
                        liberal examples drawn from actual and prospective publications. In the
                        first paper, Barbara Bordalejo will review the processes of preparation
                        undergone by the Canterbury Tales Project team in making a single
                        publication. In the second, Peter Robinson will give the background to the
                        electronic Nestle-Aland 28, outline the aims of this publication as they are
                        emerging, and show the first prototypes of this. In the third paper, Andrew
                        West, the Technical Officer for the CTA and a key member of the Anastasia
                        development team, will discuss the transformation of complex encodings into
                        richly featured actual and usable publications.
                
                
                    
                        Everything You Wanted to Know About the Canterbury Tales Project's
                            Editions and Never Dared to Ask: The Making of The Miller's Tale on
                            CD-ROM
                        Barbara Bordalejo
                        
                            When one sees an electronic edition one wonders how much work and
                                effort has gone into it and the first question that springs to mind
                                is could I do something like that? The short answer is: No, you
                                can't. There are other kinds of electronic editions that a scholar
                                could produce on his own, but the multi- witness editions of the
                                Canterbury Tales Project are just out of the range for individual
                                production. The proof of this is that the Project has developed,
                                since its beginning, partnerships and collaborations at different
                                levels with many scholars. Since its last expansion - with two new
                                members - the Canterbury Tales Project is now producing our CD-ROMs
                                more speedily. Of course, another important factor that has enormous
                                weight on the Canterbury Tales Project's production improvement, is
                                the fact that most conventions used for the conversion into computer
                                formats have long been established and tested, and are now more
                                reliable that ever before. An idea of how many scholars have
                                participated in a particular edition can be drawn by looking at the
                                opening pages of one of CDs.
                            I first approached The Wife of Bath's Prologue on CD-ROM in December
                                1999. I was then fascinated by the idea of all the manuscripts of
                                the Canterbury Tales being transcribed and published. I also held a
                                very strict textual-critical position that made me into a severe
                                documentary editor. This CD-ROM pleased me greatly - although not
                                completely - and I was particularly impressed by some of the
                                transcription policies of the Project. But what really engaged me
                                was the idea that Collate 'the main program used in our collations'
                                was such a wonderful tool that could help creating this kind of
                                materials. I was quite ignorant then and, even if I understood what
                                coding was and had tried to teach myself SGML, I was far from being
                                able to truly understand the nature and complexity of the production
                                of one of these CDs. What I did then is what most of my colleagues
                                would have done: I read everything I could get a hold of in which
                                members of the CANTERBURY TALES PROJECT had participated.
                            Eventually, I came across a statement similar to the one found in The
                                General Prologue CD-ROM:
                                    "The computer collation program we are using (Collate)
                                        permits regularization as part of the collation process.
                                        This has the great advantage of allowing deferral of
                                        regularization until all the evidence of all the spellings
                                        in all the manuscripts at any one point is available. It
                                        also permits a complete record to be made of all
                                        regularization done during the collation. Collate can also
                                        generate regularized-spelling version of each file from the
                                        regularization process."
                                
                            My interpretation was that Collate could automatically generate
                                regularized texts from the unregularized ones. This is just shows
                                how naÃ¯ve and ignorant I was. Collate is a wonderful tool and helps
                                our work in unimaginable ways, but it can not take the various
                                spellings of Middle English and regularize them to a particular
                                form. In fact, because of the nature of the language at that time, I
                                am doubtful that any automated tool could do this. So how do the
                                complex spellings of the manuscripts get transformed into a
                                regularized collation? This is just done by hand. Word by word, line
                                by line, 20.000 lines of verse in 88 fifteenth-century witness are
                                lemmatized and regularized by the Canterbury Tales Project team. The
                                process is intricate, requires a great deal of attention and
                                grammatical skills that few people arrive with, and when it is over,
                                every single one of the regularizations must be checked to make sure
                                that most mistakes are eliminated. Both the lemmatization and
                                regularization are building blocks of our spelling databases.
                            An important question that one might want to ask to the members of
                                the Canterbury Tales Project is why should anyone go through the
                                process of creating very detailed transcriptions of the manuscripts,
                                making sure that tails and flourishes are accurately represented in
                                the key manuscripts, if later one has to spend money and time in
                                taking all those differences out to produce the regularized
                                collation? The answer is quite simple, the regularized and
                                unregularized collations have very different function in the
                                CD-ROMs. Probably, the main reason to have chosen to produce a
                                regularized collation is the fact that only using this one can
                                proceed to make an adequate stemmatic analysis. Since one of the
                                main aims of the Canterbury Tales Project is to achieve a better
                                understanding of the textual tradition of the Tales and the ways in
                                which the manuscripts relate to one another, it seems clear why the
                                role of the stemmatic analysis should be a priority. One of the most
                                evident discoveries of the Project is the fact that spelling
                                variants are uninformative while using phylogenetic programs - which
                                are used as an important part of our stemmatic analysis - and that,
                                in fact, these create 'white noise' and impair the results yielded
                                by evolutionary software.
                            Using examples drawn from my work on The Miller's Tale on CD-ROM I
                                would like to demonstrate some of the problems that we face in our
                                everyday work. Moreover, I will discuss other issues generated by
                                editions of the kind produced by the Project, such as working with
                                other people - nearby and far away, consistency, revision and
                                responsibility. In cases like this, it becomes clear that the more
                                people work in a particular edition, the bigger the need for strict
                                rules to be applied in each particular case.

                            The Greek New Testament represents, by every measure, the Everest of
                                textual scholarship. Firstly, it is simply the biggest: with over
                                five thousand surviving manuscripts and other witnesses, from over
                                two thousand years, it dwarfs every other textual tradition of a
                                major western text (some Indian textual traditions, where copying
                                onto palm leaf manuscripts persists to this day, are larger in terms
                                of sheer numbers of manuscripts). Secondly, it is the most complex:
                                beside straight-forward copies one has to deal with a vast spectrum
                                of versions, in many languages and from many cultures, some of them
                                now deeply obscure. There is also considerable citational evidence,
                                where scraps of text are referred to in early Christian and other
                                writers, some of which bears crucial witness to textual readings,
                                even whole texts (the elusive 'Gospel of the Hebrews', for example),
                                otherwise unknown. Thirdly, it is the most intractable. Many textual
                                scholars have lived by a comfortable presumption that as one tunnels
                                upwards in a textual tradition towards the origins variation will
                                diminish, to the point where it may be eliminated altogether and a
                                single perfect and original text (in this case, indeed, the Word of
                                God) will stand forth. But the situation with the Greek New
                                Testament appears to show the precise opposite: variation becomes
                                greater, not less, as we move back in time, and the earliest
                                substantial evidence we have from the second century shows witnesses
                                which differ more from each other and from the late text than do
                                later writers.
                            Add to this that the Greek New Testament is, by some considerable
                                margin, the most important single text of western civilization, and
                                indeed the foundation of nearly two millennia of our culture, and we
                                have a formidable task. Six centuries of textual scholarship has
                                defined itself against this task, and the names of the editors who
                                have struggled with this text and its problems is an impressive
                                rollcall: Erasmus, Griesbach, Bentley, Lachmann, Tischendorf,
                                Westcott, Hort, von Soden, Nestle, Aland. Sooner or later, every
                                theory of textual scholarship, and every technological development,
                                must test itself against the Greek New Testament. The early
                                development of printing in the west (and perhaps even its invention)
                                was driven by the church's need for uniform texts; one could argue
                                that printing reached its first technical peak in the polyglot Bible
                                of 1515. Now, it is the turn of computing technology and electronic
                                publishing to confront this challenge. Over the last five years, the
                                Institut fÃ¼r Neutestamentliche Textforschung, MÃ¼nster, (INTF) has
                                been progressively incorporating computer-assisted techniques in the
                                preparation of the new Editio Critica Maior series of the Greek New
                                Testament (ECM). The most recent volumes of this have used computer
                                methods not only in preparation of the printed text, but at every
                                stage in gathering the data on which the printed text is built. The
                                manuscripts chosen for inclusion in the ECM apparatus are now
                                transcribed in full, collated using Robinson’s Collate software
                                (originally developed for medieval vernacular texts), and the
                                collation output to a database where it is integrated with other
                                evidence and the apparatus for the ECM print editions created.
                            This work involved testing and development of computer techniques
                                capable of coping with the special demands of the Greek New
                                Testament. For example: Robinson has had to add many new facilities
                                to Collate, and enable it to cope with collation of up to 500 texts
                                at once. At the same time, the INTF has had to redesign how it
                                carries out the work, rebuilding it around full transcription and
                                collation of the manuscripts rather than manual excerpting of
                                variants. So far, this work has been limited to the making of
                                printed texts. Recently, and encouraged by the success of this
                                process, the INTF and their publisher, the Deutsche
                                Bibelgesellschaft (DBG) have determined on a more ambitious program:
                                the making of an electronic edition of the 28th edition of the
                                Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament. The Nestle-Aland text is far the
                                most widely used text of the Greek New Testament: it is the text
                                published in the United Bible Society publications, it is studied in
                                seminaries and used in translations worldwide. Just to make an
                                electronic version of this printed text and apparatus alone would be
                                a signal advance, and in itself a considerable challenge. However,
                                the INTF and DBG propose far more: the electronic version of the
                                existing text should be interwoven with full transcripts of the key
                                manuscripts (and, as time passes, more and more manuscripts),
                                collations of these, and analytic tools including the facility to
                                carry out dynamic comparisions of manuscripts, build stemmatic
                                analyses from the comparisons, and much more. Beyond this, the
                                possibilities of linking to on-line manuscript images and
                                lexicographic resources open yet further perspectives.
                            Much of this will be built on the existing Collate software, and over
                                the next years Robinson and other Leicester staff (both from the
                                Centre and from Scholarly Digital Editions [SDE]) will be working
                                with Wachtel and other staff at the INTF and DBG to set up the work
                                practices necessary to support this, and developing a series of
                                prototype publications. With funding from the Deutsche
                                Forschungsgemeineschaft and the DBG, the first of these prototypes
                                will be publically available on the web in February 2003. We will
                                present a version of this first prototype at the conference. All
                                text will be encoded in XML, following the TEI guidelines. The first
                                prototypes, at least, will use Anastasia, the electronic publication
                                system developed by SDE.
                        
                    
                
                
                    
                        Turning Complicated Texts into Real Publications
                        Andrew West
                        
                            Turning basic text into a simple publication can be a relatively easy
                                matter. It could be as easy as using a word processor or typewriter,
                                but what if the text is more complicated? For example, what if the
                                text was written in a different language, or you needed to include
                                information pertaining to the original physical document? These can
                                be some of the obstacles in creating a digital publication.
                            The first step in this process is to find a means of encoding not
                                only the raw text but also the information relating to the document
                                or parts of the document. If it was a simple document produced in
                                Microsoft Word we could mark parts of the text as bold, italic etc.,
                                but this method provides nowhere near the flexibility or power which
                                is required by most. HTML, HyperText Mark-up Language, is a step
                                closer as parts of the document can be marked or tagged to describe
                                the structure, such as the title or the document body. Still this
                                method is inflexible and very restrictive in the information it
                                allows you to show. What we need is a way similar to this but also
                                allows us to define how and what information we need to keep.
                            For their transcription work the Canterbury Tales Project chose XML
                                (eXtended Mark-up Language), and before this its predecessor SGML
                                (Standard Mark-up Language) as their format for transcribing the
                                Canterbury Tales. This allows them to transcribe the manuscripts in
                                almost infinite detail, from something as simple as marking a
                                character as being a particular medieval style of letter to showing
                                that a sentence was added at a later date. For them to create a way
                                of encoding this selected information all they need do is use a tag,
                                such as &lt;added&gt;, which itself could hold extra
                                information about this occurrence of added text. So wherever there
                                is a need to include information in a portion of text either an
                                existing tag can be used or a new one created to suit their needs.
                            This style of encoding can have potential dangers. When several
                                people are working on a transcription, they need to make sure that
                                they agree on which tags they are going to be using and in which
                                circumstances they should use them, otherwise the resulting
                                transcriptions would be inconsistent and impossible to use in a real
                                publication. In an effort to solve this problem Peter Robinson,
                                director of the Canterbury Tales Project, helped produce the T.E.I.
                                documentation. This set of documents created the standard which the
                                C.T.P. uses to encode the manuscripts they are working on, and by
                                which all their transcribers work by in order to create a
                                consistence format for their publications.
                            So now we have a set of files with all the text and its relevant
                                information encoded within, but this format is not going to be
                                presentable to the public. What we need is to create a system that
                                can turn this information into format that can be read and navigated
                                with ease. To this end Scholarly Digital Editions created Anastasia,
                                an application that takes the transcribers' XML files and produces
                                intermediate files which enable it to search these XML files and can
                                tailor its output to suit the needs of the publication. Anastasia
                                acts like a web server so it can be used in conjunction with a web
                                browsers such as Internet Explorer or Netscape. The benefits of a
                                system such as this is that most users will have some knowledge of
                                these applications so they will not need to learn a new system in
                                order to be able to use the publication. Other digital publication
                                applications have chosen to create their own interface for the
                                users, and this may allow them to refine the way they present the
                                information to produce a view of the information that is exactly
                                what they need. But this may have the drawback of having a steeper
                                learning curve when people start using these applications. An
                                advantage of the Anastasia system is that it gives extraordinary
                                control over the interface we present to users. This makes it
                                possible to tune interfaces precisely as we want. We are currently
                                working on integration of mySQL into Anastasia. The reason for this
                                is that there are certain operations which are very well handled by
                                databases (notably, sorting of results of searches on particular
                                fields). We also intend to integrate certain of the Collate
                                functions into the software.
                            Producing electronic publications is a long and laborious process,
                                not only in transcribing the manuscripts but also in deciding how to
                                encoding the information and then how best to let people view the
                                resulting publication. At least this part of the process can be
                                simplified by collaborating with publishers and choosing "off the
                                shelf" applications.
