                    1 Introduction 
                    SGML, and increasingly XML are the prevailing standards for text encoding
                        today. XML, a simplified subset of SGML, is commonly believed to become the
                        new standard for web publishing. One of the strengths of SGML/XML is that it
                        combines a labelled bracketed notation with an intuitive document structure
                        and a powerful formalism for constraining that structure. All SGML/XML like
                        systems, however, have problems representing non-hierarchical textual
                        features, because they require elements to nest. In practice, various
                        techniques for encoding non- hierarchical features have been developed,
                        including the use of milestone elements, fragmentation of elements, the SGML
                        feature CONCUR, and various other techniques for recreating 'virtual
                        elements' from fragments of the text. The problem with all of these
                        approaches however, is that they require application- specific logic to
                        retrieve the intended structure. SGML/XML processors are not sufficient.
                    MECS is a text encoding system designed by Claus Huitfeldt at the
                        Wittgenstein Archive in Bergen that was specifically designed to enable
                        elements to overlap. [3] MECS, on the other hand, has no defined data
                        structure. The MLCD (Markup Language for Complex Documents) project was
                        started in February 2001, and is hosted by the Center for Humanities
                        Information Technology at the University of Bergen. It aims at developing a
                        text encoding system combining the best of SGML/XML and MECS. This work has
                        resulted in a notation for a markup meta-language for complex documents,
                        TexMECS [2], and a data structure for complex documents, GODDAG. This paper
                        will present the data structure and its implementation.
                
                
                    2 A computational model for MLCD
                    In [1], Huitfeldt and Sperberg-McQueen describe a data structure for
                        overlapping hierarchies. The GODDAG, or Generalised Ordered-Descendant
                        Directed Acyclic Graph, is defined as a labelled directed acyclic graph. As
                        for the tree structures of SGML/XML documents, leaf nodes represent the
                        character data content of the document, non-terminal nodes represent
                        elements and are labelled with the generic identifier. The set of leaf nodes
                        is referred to as the graph's frontier. An arc indicates a parent-child
                        relationship, modelling containment. A node is said to dominate all nodes
                        reachable from it. There is no requirement that the graph be rooted.
                    MECS, and TexMECS allow elements to overlap arbitrarily. Overlapping elements
                        are represented in the GODDAG as nodes with shared children. All elments
                        will dominate unique and contiguous sequences of leaf nodes. TexMECS has a
                        specific syntax for encoding elements that are interrupted by other
                        material. In the TEI a part attribute is sometimes used to indicate that the
                        linear form is in some way incomplete, and that more than one element
                        constitutes the entire element. It would be useful if these elements could
                        be treated as one element on the GODDAG level, for instance to facilitate
                        proximity search. In the GODDAG the whole element is represented by one
                        node, which is the parent of the fragment elements.
                        &lt;sp who="AASE"&gt;&lt;l part="i"&gt;Peer, you're
                            lying! &lt;l&gt;&lt;sp&gt; &lt;sp who="PEER
                            GYNT"&gt; &lt;stage&gt;without stopping&lt;stage&gt;
                            &lt;l part="f"&gt;No, I'm
                            not!&lt;l&gt;&lt;sp&gt; 
                    See Figure 1 for the GODDAG structure.
                    
                        Figure 1
                    
                    In the TEI there are several examples of elements used to recreate 'virtual
                        elements' from fragments of the text. (C.f.&lt;join&gt;, &lt;span&gt;,&lt;fs&gt;.) TexMECS also includes a specific syntax for
                        so-called virtual elements, elements that are created by fragments of the
                        text that may be discontiguous or out of order. A virtual element in TexMECS
                        has an element identifier and an id reference. In the GODDAG, the virtual
                        element is labelled with its generic identifier, and is the parent of all
                        children of the referenced element. This means that applications can access
                        and process virtual elements like any other elements.
                    Below is an example, in TexMECS syntax, that shows a simple reordering of
                        lines, in one view representing a dialogue between Hughie, Luis and Dewey,
                        in another representing the haiku they are trying to remember.
                        {sp who="HUGHIE"{{p{How did that translation go?}p} {lg
                            type="haiku"{{l{da de dum de dum,}l} {l=frog{gets a new frog,}l}
                            {l{...}l}}lg} }sp} {sp who="LOUIS"{{p{Er ...}p} {lg{{l=new{it's a new
                            pond.}l}}lg} }sp} {sp who="DEWEY"{{p{Ah ...}p} {lg{{l=pond{When the old
                            pond}l}}lg} {p{Right. That's it.}p}}sp}
                            {lg{{^l^pond}{^l^frog}{^l^new}}lg} 
                    In the GODDAG generated from this example (Figure 2), both the dialogue and
                        the haiku are structured as part of the document, and none of the views is
                        dominant.

                    3 Implementation
                    A computational model of the above structure has been implemented in Java and
                        CommonLisp, along with loaders and linearisers for TexMECS, MECS and XML.
                        Using these, the GODDAG can function as a simple means of translating
                        between the various encoding schemes.
                
                
                    4 Serialization: some issues and problems
                    There is an obvious 1-1 relationship between the set of valid XML documents
                        and their tree representations. In the case of TexMECS, things are more
                        complicated. A given GODDAG structure can be serialized in different ways,
                        depending on whether nodes with multiple parents are serialized as virtual
                        elements or as overlap. On the other hand, there is a small class of TexMECS
                        documents with discontinuous elements which do not seem to correspond to any
                        GODDAG structure, if one tries to map discontinuous elements to a single
                        node. We try to formalize the relationship between GODDAG structures and
                        serializations and propose a solution for the aforementioned problem.
                
                
                    5 Conclusion
                    The work presented in this paper shows how to implement the data structures
                        and formalize some of the ideas presented in [1].
