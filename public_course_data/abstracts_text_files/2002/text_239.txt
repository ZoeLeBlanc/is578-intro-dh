                    Preparation
                    The need for parallel texts has been discussed in numerous articles in recent
                        years. This paper focuses on how to set up a corpus of parallel texts, how
                        to do research on such texts and how to export parallel texts to different
                        file types.
                    Parallel texts should be tagged in order to mark structural characteristics
                        and other additional information. 
                
                
                    Setting up parallel texts
                    The example below is taken from a joint research project between the German
                        departments of the Universities of Würzburg (Germany) and Jyväskylä
                        (Finland). The aim of the project was to describe and analyse problems of
                        contrastive word formation and to explore possibilities of text analysis.
                        For that purpose a corpus was set up consisting of complete and contemporary
                        Finnish and German literary and documentary texts and their translations
                        into the other language. The sheer number of 800,000 word forms makes it
                        obvious that commercial word processing programs cannot handle such a large
                        amount of text data. Therefore, we chose as a software tool the 'Tuebingen
                        System of Text Processing Programs' (Tustep).
                    One decisive factor in building a parallel corpus of two or more texts is -
                        if you do not work with semantic features - that there must be the same
                        number of structural tags in all basic files that relate to each other. For
                        our purposes it was sufficient to restrict the alignment to paragraphs only.
                        The following example demonstrates how a German text and its Finnish
                        translation are aligned so that both can either be read on the PC-screen.
                        The extract consists of three short paragraphs which are taken from the
                        novel Der Tangospieler by Christoph Hein (1989):
                        
                            
                                5.7  |&lt;p&gt;"Was ist mit Ihrer Hand?" fragte der Beamte, der vor
                                5.8  |ihm saß und ihm zusah.
                                5.23 |&lt;p rend=missing&gt;Dann betrachtete er sein Werk, es
                                6.1  |sah aus wie die Unterschrift eines Achtjährigen. Er
                                6.2  |nickte zufrieden.
                                6.29 |&lt;p&gt;Am Bahnhof ging er zum Schalter und verlangte eine
                                6.30 |Fahrkarte nach Leipzig.
                            
                        
                    The Finnish version (Sästäjä) reads:
                            
                                5.7  |&lt;p&gt;"Mikä kättä vaivaa?" kysyi virkailija, joka istui
                                     |vastapäätä
                                5.8  |häntä katsellen.
                                5.25 |&lt;p&gt;Sitten hän tiiraili aikaansaannostaan. Se näytti
                                5.26 |kahdeksanvuotiaan nimikirjoitukselta. Hän nyökkäsi
                                     |tyytyväisenä.
                                6.24 |&lt;p&gt;Asemalla hän meni luukulle ja pyysi lipun Leipzigiin.
                            
                        
                    Both texts show their original structure as they were published. In order to
                        do research easily on both texts at the same time it is necessary to combine
                        them into one single file and to align all related units. The files are
                        reformatted; the marked units are given a running number and merged into
                        one. The newly created file can be edited by using the Tustep text
                        editor:
                
                
                    Searching in parallel texts
                    The Tustep text editor provides all basic functions common to other word
                        processing programs. In addition to that it can handle complex instructions
                        for pattern matching. You can search for
                            several specific strings such as character strings or words or
                                parts of words, at the same time excluding other character strings
                                which you do not want to see (an instruction such as
                                so,,,-pf-kl-st-fr--ist- shows only ( so) the clusters 'pf', 'kl',
                                'st', 'fr' with the exception of 'ist');
                            abstract strings such as capital or small letters, any standard or
                                extended ASCII character, digits, identical characters, elements
                                which depend upon characters on their left or right border;
                                exclusions can also be made (the instruction
                                so,,,/&gt;*&gt;*&gt;=02&gt;=01/ shows any
                                combinations of two small letters (&gt;*), followed by the
                                second one (&gt;=02) and then the first one again. Thus,
                                patterns like 'assa', 'elle', and 'niin' are displayed);
                            any character in combination with a frequency declaration
                                (&gt;&lt;3 meaning 'minimum of 3', &gt;&lt;0 'may be
                                missing', &lt;&gt;9 'maximum of 9', &lt;&gt;0 'any
                                number of');
                            any combination of the three above. And there are many other
                                possibilities.
                        
                    If you want to find all German nouns in our text above, for example, which
                        are movated by using the suffix '-in', you could use an instruction like
                        so,,1-45,-&lt;*&lt;&gt;0&gt;*&gt;1&gt;2&gt;|&gt;&lt;0&gt;3-
                        which searches all lines of the current file from the first to the
                        forty-fifth position, i.e. only in the German column, to determine whether
                        there is a capital letter (&lt;*), followed by any number of
                        (&lt;&gt;0) small letters (&gt;*), a member of character group
                        &gt;1, of string group &gt;2, which has on its right side
                        (&gt;|) an optional (&gt;&lt;0) member of character group
                        &gt;3. Before entering this search instruction the three groups just
                        mentioned have to be defined. The group &gt;1 contains all small letters
                        with the exception of the vowels, which cannot occur before the suffix
                        '-in', &gt;2 holds the strings in and innen, and &gt;3 contains all
                        characters that could possibly follow the noun such as a blank or a
                        punctuation mark (.,;:!?"). Detailed information on the syntax of
                        instructions and other topics is given by Stahl (1996).
                    
                    As a result, this so-instruction displays the first set of occurrences that
                        fulfil the pattern matching requirements in Christoph Hein's novel. By
                        changing so in the instruction above to sa (show around) the context of each pattern is
                        displayed.
                    The user is able to find these forms only by means of pattern matching and
                        not with the help of semantic tags. He or she is completely independent and
                        not restricted to any predefined information.
                
                
                    Exporting parallel texts
                    The next example is taken from the material of an international intensive
                        course on "Multilingual text processing" which was given in Galway in 1997
                        with support from the EC Erasmus program. It is based upon Die Nachtwachen von Bonaventura by August Klingemann together
                        with its translations into English by Gillespie (1972), into Italian by
                        Collini (1990), and into Finnish by Kolehmainen, Oikarinen and Rahikainen
                        (1997). Among other tasks, one aim of the course was to align the four texts
                        horizontally sentence by sentence, and to export them to a PostScript file
                        for printing and to a HTML file for web publishing. For economic and safety
                        reasons the four text files are kept separate from each other. The beginning
                        of the German original text file reads:
                        [1-9] Erste Nachtwache
                            [2-9] Die Nachtstunde schlug; ich hüllte mich in 
                            meine abenteuerliche Vermummung, nahm die Pike und 
                            das Horn zur Hand, ging in die Finsterniß hinaus und
                            rief die Stunde ab, nachdem ich mich durch ein Kreuz
                            gegen die bösen Geister geschützt hatte.
                        
                    The three translations contain the same structure. The original and the
                        translations are exported to PostScript by typesetting them with the
                        Tustep-typesetting program (#Satz). Only a few of all typesetting
                        possibilities are made use of when the four texts are processed to produce
                        an output of aligned sentences. First, they are typeset in narrow columns
                        one after the other to determine the linebreaks. Four new destination files
                        are generated which show the final layout of all lines. The text blocks
                        holding the grammatical sentences, however, are still of different length.
                        These units of all text files are compared with each other to find out which
                        is the longest among the four languages; if necessary empty space is
                        inserted into the shorter ones. When the text is now typeset again with the
                        inserted empty lines, all units are of equal length:
                    D. Lewis and P. Stahl describe the source code, which you can download from
                             (&gt; Programme &gt;
                        Nützliches), as well as possibilities of evaluating a literary
                    translation.
                
                
                    Output to other formats
                    The same four basic text files that were used above can also be combined into
                        one single HTML-file. To do this task you need about 40 lines of Tustep
                            code:

                    This program file contains all necessary commands to achieve our goal. In the
                        first line a temporary file is created and given the file name 'BV'. The
                        four basic text files are opened for reading (l. 2) and copied to the new
                        destination file 'BV' (l. 5-8), which is then sorted (l. 10-19). A HTML
                        header is written to the file 'BV' (l. 21-25); the standard file containing
                        the sorted units is added to the same destination file, and while the
                        copying takes place, several source strings are exchanged for new
                        destination strings to produce HTML tags and entities (l. 27-36). Finally,
                        three closing tags are added (l. 38-41). A permanent non-Tustep file is
                        created ('BV.HTM') which 'BV' is exported to (l. 43-44). A web browser
                        displays the result: 
                    All examples show that text files provide the basis for all other tasks. They
                        can be aligned in such a way that a user is able to search the text for
                        words and patterns he or she is interested in, or they can be exported to
                        other coding schemes.
