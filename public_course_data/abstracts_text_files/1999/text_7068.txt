                n 1994, a new wordclass tagset for Dutch was designed (WOTAN; Berghmans, 1994),
                    for use in the upgrade of a tagged corpus of more than a million words
                    (including the Eindhoven corpus; uit den Boogaart, 1975) and the subsequent
                    derivation of an automatic tagger. WOTAN was based on the most popular
                    descriptive grammar of Dutch (ANS; Geerts et al., 1984), from which the encoded
                    distinctions were selected using two criteria: a) importance to potential users,
                    as estimated from interviews and b) feasibility of (semi-)automatic derivation
                    from the existing tagging, given the lack of time for extensive manual changes.
                    WOTAN was judged to be a good compromise and has since been used in several
                    tagging projects and experiments in the Netherlands and Belgium.
                Yet, WOTAN had its shortcomings, leading to the creation of a successor. WOTAN-2
                    adds some important distinctions originally left out because they needed manual
                    intervention, and aims for compatibility with the EAGLES guidelines, the
                    (extensively) revised version of the ANS (Haeseryn et al., 1997), the CELEX
                    database and the AMAZON syntactic parser. Another, more uncertain, influence is
                    the tagset to be used for the Spoken Dutch Corpus, which is presently under
                    construction.
                The poster will present:
                        the differences between WOTAN and WOTAN-2
                        the influence of the (sometimes contradictory) compatibility issues on
                            the tagset
                        additions to (or deviations from) the EAGLES proposal necessitated by
                            decisions for WOTAN-2
                        the upgrade of the WOTAN-tagged Eindhoven corpus to a WOTAN-2
                            version
