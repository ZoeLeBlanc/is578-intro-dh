                    The ARTFL database provides material for studying the literary fortunes of
                        the image of the poet in 19th century French literature. The patterns in
                        distributions of allusions to poets and poetry are compared to those of
                        sales of books of poems to gauge the importance of literary allusions to
                        poetry as a reflection of societal trends.
                
                
                    Data
                    The ARTFL database for the period 1789-1914 is examined, since the French
                        Revolution and the outbreak of World War I are useful boundaries to the
                        historical period which can be called the 19th century for sake of
                        simplicity. Three search strings, poEme.*, poEsie.*, and poEt.* retrieve all
                        forms of the words "poème" (poem), "poésie" (poetry), "poète" (poet), and
                        "poétique" (poetic). Other words like "vers" (line of poetry, but also worm,
                        and towards) are not retrieved because of the problem of polysemy. This
                        approach can be justified in terms of the theory of semantic categories
                        developed by Lakoff (1987) and is similar to the one used by Olsen (1991) to
                        examine gender representation in French literature.
                    Results produced by the ARTFL search engine are divided into chronological
                        periods using the break-down suggested by Imbs (1971), and are further
                        divided into the following genres on the basis of what is provided by the
                        ARTFL search engine: Novel, Theater, Poetry, Non-Literary Prose. In all
                        cases of period and genre identification, decisions embodied in the
                        structure of the ARTFL database are respected. The raw numbers provided by
                        ARTFL have been divided by the number of words in all the texts in a given
                        period and genre, then multiplied by 10,000 so that relative frequencies can
                        be compared.

                    The high number of allusions to poetry in the theater of the period 1833-41,
                        in poetic texts for the period 1833-1849, and in the novel of 1842-49
                        corresponds to the Romantic period in France. Indeed, Lamartine, a leading
                        Romantic poet was named provisional President of the Republic in 1848. The
                        decline in the allusions to poets and poetry seems to correspond with the
                        rise of realism in literature, and with the collapse of Romantic ideals of
                        political power after the coup d'état engineered by Napoleon III in
                        1851.
                    A second period of increased importance of poetry begins in 1880-92 in the
                        novel and continues to 1914, with similar but less systematic increases in
                        the theater and in poetry itself. This has led certain historians of
                        literature, like Echelard (1994), and Lagarde and Michard (1969) to talk
                        about an increase of prestige and influence of poets and poetry in the final
                        years of the 19th century.
                
                
                    Discussion
                    The ARTFL search engine provides a list in descending order of frequency of
                        the texts which produced the allusions to a given term. What is particularly
                        noticeable in these data is the familiarity of the names of the authors of
                        the early 19th century who frequently alluded to poetry: Balzac,
                        Chateaubriand, Hugo, Musset, Vigny. The late 19th century authors who
                        contribute to the second, and smaller, rise in allusions to poetry are much
                        closer in time, but less familiar, even to a specialist in French
                        literature: Bloy, France, Gobineau, Huysmans, Péladan, Rolland. Poetry as a
                        cultural phenomenon seems to have been progressively marginalised from the
                        mid to the late 19th century.

                    Not only did the late 19th century production of books of poetry never come
                        close to equaling the numbers achieved in the high Romantic period
                        (1830-40), but the proportion of volumes of literary texts devoted to poetry
                        is considerably smaller at the end of the 19th century than at the
                        beginning. This empirical information can be combined with the impression
                        that less important literary personalities stressed the importance of poetry
                        at the end of the period than at the beginning, to produce a general
                        interpretation. It would seem, then, that while poetic vision was an
                        important social force during the Romantic period, those who knew what the
                        society valued, because they produced books for the market, did not consider
                        it important in the years immediately preceding the First World War, in
                        spite of what certain critics were to suggest at a later date.
                
                
                    Conclusion
                    The ARTFL database provides information which allows one to evaluate the
                        importance of the theme of the poet in French literature. The society in
                        general, not just those who write for publication, is then, as now, the
                        final arbiter of what is important and what is not in a given culture at a
                        particular time. The information provided by the ARTFL search engine about
                        the names of those writers who stressed the importance of poetry can be
                        related to general knowledge to suggest that the late 19th century
                        renaissance of interest in poetry was not an important social force, when
                        compared to the Romantic period. Independent information, in the form of
                        publication data, confirms this judgment.
