                    Semantic Fields
                    Studying semantic fields or literary themes in texts confronts researchers
                        with a paradox. A computer string search will produce a list of the
                        frequencies of words potentially related to the semantic field. But polysemy
                        implies an un-measurable difference between the potential allusion and the
                        real allusion. The semantic field of solitude is
                        important from sociological and psychological perspectives as an indication
                        of imperfect adaptation to one's milieu. It is also a frequently occurring
                        literary theme.
                    The only practical response is disambiguation by human informants. But the
                        reliability of such a process is a concern. Singh (1986) and Fokkema (1988)
                        discuss the matter in a theoretical and speculative mode without systematic
                        empirical evidence. Nothing bearing directly on the topic can be found in
                        recent issues of Computers and the Humanities or
                            Literary and Linguistic Computing.
                    The correctness of a given choice by an individual informant or rater is
                        generally unknowable. Usually, such a choice is a matter of degree and
                        judgment within the cultural context of a language. The consistency of
                        markup from one informant to another is a likely reasonable touchstone for
                        assessing the reliability of the disambiguation process.
                
                
                    Data
                    Nine 20th century novels were chosen for this analysis: Bernanos, Journal d'un curé de campagne, Camus, L'Étranger and La Chute, Céline,
                            Voyage au bout de la nuit, Gide, L'Immoraliste and La Porte
                            étroite, Mauriac, Le Noeud de Vipères,
                        Proust, La Fugitive, and Sartre, La Nausée.
                    French thesauri identify seventy words (in the sense of lemmata) related to
                        the concept of solitude. These strings were used to search the texts for
                        words potentially related to solitude in the ARTFL database. Words centered
                        in 60 characters of context were given to six informants with minimal
                        instructions: mark the words, which from a reading of the context, do not
                        evoke the concept of human solitude and go back to the ARTFL database for
                        more context in doubtful cases.
                    Table 1 summarizes the number of allusions to human solitude. Note that the
                        range of the number of counts of allusions to solitude varies widely
                        according to the text examined.
                    To assess the impact of providing a greater amount of context to informants,
                        300 characters of context from the original text were obtained using the
                        same set of strings as for 60 characters of context. Identical instructions
                        were given to six informants--two of whom participated in the first
                        project.
                    Table 2 summarizes the number of allusions to human solitude for a context of
                        300 characters. When a larger context is provided, the range of variability
                        in the results increases. On the other hand, the consistency of the raters
                        is slightly improved.
                
                
                    Analysis
                    The sample intraclass correlation coefficient, denoted as formula ICC(3,1) by
                        Shrout and Fleiss (1979), has been chosen as the measure of agreement among
                        the informants. For dichotomous responses, an intraclass correlation
                        coefficient of one-quarter for a sample consisting of two informants is to
                        be interpreted to reveal that two informants were in agreement for
                        twenty-five per cent of the observations after correcting for the
                        possibility that any agreements of the two informants were entirely due to
                        chance
                    The measure of reliability of a sum of responses from a random sample of a
                        set of a fixed number of raters drawn from a population of raters is known
                        as the Spearman-Brown prophecy after Spearman (1910) and Brown (1910).
                        Cronbach's alpha, due to Cronbach (1951), is an estimate of the
                        Spearman-Brown prophecy.
                    Both the Spearman-Brown prophecy and Cronbach's alpha are increasing
                        functions of the intraclass correlation--parameter and statistic,
                        respectively--and each asymptotically equal 100% in the limit as the number
                        of raters increases without bound despite the consideration that adding more
                        raters only increases the chances that everybody will not agree.
                    Statements made regarding a population based on a sample must be qualified by
                        a probability clause. The standard choice for a probability clause is such
                        that the statement be correct in the long run, if the statistical procedure
                        were to be done unboundedly many times, 95% of the time--or nineteen times
                        out of twenty. So a measure of the degree of difficulty associated with a
                        specific text in determining whether there is an allusion to solitude is
                        given by the minimum number of informants to achieve a value of 95% for
                        Cronbach's alpha nineteen times out of twenty.
                
                
                    Results
                    Hypothesis tests revealed statistically significant differences regarding
                        reliability among the different texts and among the two character-string
                        lengths. Further exploratory analysis ruled out a particular informant, a
                        particular part of speech, or a particular class of frequency of use as
                        being influential.
                    The 95% confidence intervals for the intraclass correlation coefficient are
                        given in Table 3 for both 60 character and 300 character groups surrounding
                        each type. Note that for each novel the confidence interval for rater
                        reliability is shifted to the left with the 300 character groups compared to
                        the 60 character groups. With more context, the estimate of reliability
                        becomes lower.
                    Note the lack of overlap for the 95% confidence intervals for the two sizes
                        of character groups for each of the novels by Bernanos, Céline, and Proust.
                        It is conjectured that as the sample size surrounding each type increases,
                        there is more opportunity for subjectivity based on personal opinion.
                    Table 4 presents the number of informants required to achieve 95% for
                        Cronbach's alpha nineteen times out of twenty for 60 and 300 character
                        contexts. For each novel, as the size of context increases, the number of
                        informants required to achieve 95% for Cronbach's alpha increases. Moreover,
                        the size of a jury to decide whether a word alludes to human solitude with
                        300 characters of context ought to be no fewer than 45 based on the novels
                        surveyed.
                    With respect to literary analysis, note that the novels of Camus have a
                        greater spread in jury size than those of Gide.
                
                
                    Conclusion
                    It appears that the use of informants for studying semantic fields, or
                        literary themes, is justifiable from a statistical perspective. However, the
                        large numbers of informants or jury members appears prohibitive.
                        Paradoxically, reliability appears to decrease as the number of characters
                        of content increases. Further studies are needed to determine whether
                        increases in reliability can be obtained by changing the focus from a word
                        to a sentence or longer passage.
                    These results suggest a high degree of subjectivity when a single individual
                        scores the semantic content of literary data. The meaning of individual
                        words in context is a matter of opinion, and cannot be taken as definitive
                        until a high degree of consensus among a large number of raters or
                        informants is achieved.
