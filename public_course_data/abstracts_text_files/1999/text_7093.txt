                    Various computationally intensive statistical models are available for the
                        analysis of word frequency distributions (e.g., Carroll, 1967; Sichel 1975,
                        and Chitashvili and Baayen, 1993). These models provide linguists and
                        lexicographers with elegant means for obtaining sample-size invariant
                        characteristic textual measures, for extrapolating the development of the
                        vocabulary beyond sample sizes larger than the observed text size, and for
                        estimating the population vocabulary size.
                    Thusfar, these models have not been used widely, which is not surprising
                        given the absence of software implementing these models. At the conference,
                        we will present the beta version of LEXSTATS, a user-friendly GUI interface
                        to a series of C programs that implement a wide range of word frequency
                        analyses. LEXSTATS and the underlying C code will become available as
                        freeware under the GNU software license.
                    We will illustrate LEXSTATS by applying it to word frequency distributions of
                        various kinds of texts as well as to word frequency distributions of a range
                        of morphological categories.
