                    The STELLA project (Software for Teaching English and Scottish Language and
                        Literature) has served the School of English and Scottish Language and
                        Literature at the University of Glasgow since 1987. We have produced
                        teaching packages and brought research databases and other resources into
                        use in teaching. All the programs have been thoroughly tested in the
                        classroom, and have been subjected to comment and detailed criticism by
                        thousands of students at Glasgow and elsewhere, and their teachers, since
                        their first appearance. The teaching packages combine text, online help, and
                        exercise materials.
