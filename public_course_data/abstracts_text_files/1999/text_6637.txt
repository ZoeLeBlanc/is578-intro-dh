                    Summary
                    Models for word frequency distributions are relevant for a wide range of
                        domains of inquiry, including authorship studies, statistical language
                        engineering, theoretical linguistics, and linguistic synergetics. For
                        inferences based on such models to be useful, they should provide accurate
                        descriptions of the data to which they are fitted. This paper shows that
                        improved fits may sometimes be obtained by analysing word frequency
                        distributions as mixtures of two or more distinct component distributions,
                        with the gain in accuracy outweighing the increased number of model
                        parameters.
                
                
                    Introduction
                    Currently, there are three models for word frequency distributions available
                        that take the dynamics of the development of spectral characteristics as a
                        function of sample size into account: the lognormal model, the extended
                        generalized Zipf's model, and the generalized inverse Gauss-Poisson model
                        (GIGP), see Chitashvili and Baayen (1993), for a review of these LNRE
                        models. Although many empirical word frequency distributions are
                        well-described by one or more of these models, there are also word frequency
                        distributions for which no adequate fit is available. Baayen and Tweedie
                        (1998) discuss informally a data set concerning the frequencies of use of
                        Dutch words with the suffix -heid (cf. -ness in English) which illustrates this
                        point.
                    The word frequency distribution of -heid is
                        problematic because the medium frequency ranges of the spectrum are more
                        densely populated than expected by the LNRE models. This suggests that we
                        might be dealing with a mixture of two, or more, distributions, rather than
                        with a single homogeneous distribution. The question we have set ourselves
                        is: Is it possible to find two component LNRE models that jointly provide an
                        improved fit to the observed frequency spectrum of -HEID?
                
                
                    Mixture Models
                    Mixture models describe distributions where the data can be drawn from one or
                        more sources. Our starting point is a word frequency distribution spectrum
                        without any indication of how it is to be decomposed into its two
                        components. In general, when we model a word frequency spectrum we are
                        interested in finding expected values of the elements V(m,N), the number of
                        words occurring m times in a text of length N. The parameters of LNRE models
                        are then chosen to make the expected value of the spectrum elements,
                        E[V(m,N)] as close to the observed V(m,N) as possible. When a single
                        distribution is not enough to deal with the observed data, we can consider
                        the use of a mixture distribution, where the expected values are made up as
                        follows: 
                        E[V(m,N)] = E_1[V(m,pN)] + E_2[V(m,(1-p)N)], 
                        where p is the proportion of the data coming
                        from the first distribution, usually called the mixing parameter, and (1-p)
                        the proportion which comes from a second distribution. E_1 and E_2 indicate
                        the expected values under the different distributions.
                    It can be shown for each of the LNRE models that 
                        E[V(m,pN)|Z,...] = p E[V(m,N)|Z/p,...] 
                        with Z the LNRE
                        parameter of the distribution. This general relation, which expresses a form
                        of self-similarity in word frequency distributions, allows us to show that
                        limiting properties of the mixture, such as its estimated population number
                        of types, is the sum of its mixture components. Similarly, expressions of
                        variances and covariances of the spectrum elements can be derived, so that
                        the mixture model itself is again a complete LNRE model.
                
                
                    -HEID as a Mixture Distribution
                    Figure 1 plots the number of types V(m,N) with frequency m in a sample of
                        size N as a function of m, for m = 2, ..., 15 in the left panel, and for
                        m=15, ..., 100 in the right panel, using dots (N=167353). The dashed line
                        represents the GIGP fit to the data (\hat{Z} = 41.5554, \hat{b} =
                        0.00765648, \hat{\gamma} = -0.446889), which overestimates for low m and
                        underestimates for larger m. Other LNRE models provide even worse fits to
                        the data. The solid line represents the mixture model for a Lognormal
                        component (\hat{Z} = 200, \hat{\sigma} = 2.05) and a GIGP component (\hat{b}
                        = 0.000000002093, \hat{Z} = 82.9848, \hat{\gamma} = -0.565). The mixing
                        parameter p equals 0.96. The MSE (mean squared error) for the GIGP fit is
                        3390.6, and X^{2}(13) = 1734.7, p &lt; .1*10^-18. For the mixture model, the
                        MSE is reduced to 97.1, and with X^{2}(10) = 19.58, p=0.0334 we have no
                        reason to reject the model. We have obtained similar improvements in
                        goodness-of-fit for other word frequency distributions that thusfar resisted
                        adequate modeling. At the conference, we will present further examples of
                        the advantages of using mixture models where `pure' models fail, and we will
                        demonstrate the software that we have been developing to fit mixture LNRE
                        models to empirical data.
