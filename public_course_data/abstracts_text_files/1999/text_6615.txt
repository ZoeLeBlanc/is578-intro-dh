                Abstract
                The Art Museum Image Consortium (AMICO  ) is
                    a not-for-profit organization formed in late 1997 to create a digital multimedia
                    library of art available for licensed educational use. Twenty-three founding
                    members contributed digital documentation of approximately 20,000 works in their
                    collection to a test library. In collaboration with the Research Libraries Group
                    (RLG), AMICO made this collection available to sixteen universities as part of
                    the University Testbed . This paper summarizes the results of the AMICO
                    University Testbed, including user studies, focus groups conducted by AMICO, and
                    online surveys conducted by Cornell Universities Interactive Media Group. The
                    Authors will review their implications for the design and delivery of rich
                    primary source materials for humanities scholarship, including the first edition
                    of the AMICO Library -- approximately 40,000 works from 30 institutions -- to be
                    released in July 1999.
                The Authors: Jennifer Trant, Executive Director, AMICO and David Bearman,
                    Director Strategy and Research, AMICO have been involved in development of
                    online humanities knowledge bases for several decades. They co-chair the annual
                    Museums and the Web Conference and the bi-annual International Cultural Heritage
                    Informatics Meetings (ICHIM), and consult for consortia of cultural heritage
                    institutions worldwide in their capacities as partners in Archives &amp; Museum
                    Informatics. Their papers and research reports have appeared in numerous online
                    and print journals.
