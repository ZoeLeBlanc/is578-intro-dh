                Digital libraries are important in language learning, in teaching of linguistics
                    and in computer-assisted language learning (McEnery and Wilson 1993). Today in
                    the stage of preparation is the RUSSIAN XX CENTURY LITERATURE digital library --
                    the Russian text corpus with works of more than 200 Russian 20th Century
                    writers. The texts are taken from printed resources, CD-resources and Internet.
                    The chief distinction of the digital library is its strong connection with the
                    set of Russian electronic dictionaries and language processing tools,
                    particularly dependent on the language processor Russicon (Belyaev, B.M.,
                    Surcis, A.S., Yablonsky, S.A., 1993; Yablonsky, S.A., 1990; Yablonsky, S.A.,
                    1994; Yablonsky, S.A., 1997, a, 1998,1999). Every word of the linguistically
                    encoded corpus simultaneously is the entry word of mentioned dictionaries.
                By connecting the Language Processor Russicon and dictionaries to Russian digital
                    library one may view language learning aids as performing of (Yablonsky S.A.,
                    1994; Yablonsky S.A., 1997, a, b, 1998):
                        reading of Russian text accessible via digital library;
                        getting on-line help for every word in the texts that provides the
                            following facilities: a morphological parse, lemma, the entry to the
                            word in the set of dictionaries (in a bilingual X/Russian dictionary, in
                            explanatory monolingual Russian one etc.);
                        automatic generation and verification of different variants of
                            inflection paradigms for the word (containing only one correct variant)
                            and verification of the right answer;
                        automatic generation and verification of prefix(s), stem(s),
                            suffix(s), ending, lemma for given word form after learner's
                            input;
                        automatic generation of test texts with lacunas and verification of
                            them after learner's input etc.
