                The practice of text encoding, based on the Guidelines of the Text Encoding
                    Initiative,[TEI] has prompted the need of a critical reflection on the adequacy
                    of current encoding theory.[RMD] In its turn, the debate on the theory of markup
                    [RTWb, RTWa, BH] has elicited new investigations on markup schemes as document
                    grammars.[SH] Therefore, one central issue of markup theory seems to reside in
                    clarifying the relationship between document grammars and textual
                    structures.
                A basic ambiguity hovers over the discussion on text encoding--an "inadvertent
                    shift" from document to textual structures, from textual representation to
                    textual model.[BR] It seems to lurk in the very definition of "what is markup"
                    endorsed by the TEI: if markup is defined as "all the information contained in a
                    computer file other than the 'text' itself," how can "'any' aspect of a text of
                    importance to a researcher" ever "be signalled by markup"? [BS,2] Either markup
                    represents that information which "'is not' part of the text"[CRdR,934] and is
                    'other' than text, or markup represents aspects of that information which "'is'
                    part of the text, and is 'the same as' text."[BR] But not both, unless 'text' is
                    taken in two different senses, as information "coded as characters or sequences
                    of characters,"[D,1] i.e. as a digital expression on the one hand, and as the
                    "content of the expression"[CRdR,934] on the other. The representation of any
                    information content is not the information content which is represented by that
                    representation and one should be wary of identifying textual structures with
                    document structures or document grammars.
                Reference seems appropriate here to Hjelmslev's fourfold distinction between
                    "form" and "substance" respectively of the "expression" and the "content" of
                    discourse.[H,47-70] Hjelmslev's model bears the stamp of Saussure's notion of
                    the text as "a two-level signifier-signified construction" in the stress on the
                    "inseparability of expression and content," but also enables us to distinguish
                    between the form of the representation and the form of the content represented
                    thereby.[S,39] If we find "acceptable" a "very broad definition" of textual
                    structure as "the set of the latent relations among the parts" of a literary
                    work,[S,34] we should ask ourselves how such relations can be accounted for in
                    terms of the document grammar enforced by a certain encoding scheme. Is, for
                    instance, the OHCO model,[dRDMR] or any model appropriately "refining our notion
                    of text"[RMD] an adequate one? Can it provide a suitable data structure to
                    process textual information for text critical or interpretational purposes?
                It has been argued that it is "difficult" for markup "to express structure that
                    is not a subset of character positions in the text,"[RTWa,9-10] and that it is
                    so precisely because markup "inherits"[RTWa,2] the "order of text,"[RTWa,10]
                    defined as the linear order of the string of characters in which it is embedded.
                    In an SGML-like "strongly embedded" kind of markup, the position within the
                    character string "is information bearing", whereas a "weakly embedded" kind of
                    markup is informative regardless its position and it could be placed
                    "out-of-line."[RTWa,3-4] All this means that SGML-based encoding "reduces the
                    structural properties of a text to the structural properties of a document,"[BR]
                    because "the properties" of the structures which this kind of markup can
                    describe "are largely derivative of the properties of the document," the linear
                    stream of characters "in which it is embedded."[RTWa,3-4] Again, the form of the
                    representation cannot be mistaken for the form of the content which is thereby
                    represented.
                The structural properties of an encoded document expressed by means of a strongly
                    embedded markup scheme can therefore be described as essentially 'notational'.
                    The notational properties of decimal, as opposed to binary or any other form of
                    numerical notation, do not affect the arithmetical properties of numbers. In
                    other words, "markup is not a data model, it is a type of data
                    representation"[RTWa,16] and different forms of text representation should match
                    data models capable of expressing the set of latent relations constituting
                    textual structure.
                Both text critical and interpretational procedures require non-linear models of
                    the text.[Ba, Bb] Variant readings of a complex textual tradition cannot, in
                    general, be represented in a linear way, neither can complex specimens of
                    authorial manuscripts. Competing interpretational perspectives can detect
                    concurrent textual structures. Also "historical text", or textual information
                    enabling historical enquiry, can be conceived as multi-layered and demands
                    non-linear models.[Ta,55-57] An "extended string" data type able to provide
                    non-linear data models for processing textual information has been introduced
                    precisely for this purpose.[Tb]
                The extended string internal representation allows import/export of different
                    forms of marked-up data for the same data model, of different "formats" for the
                    same "formalism,"[J,75-76] and makes it possible to use concurrent encoded
                    representations depending on different interpretations of the same text; or to
                    combine encoded transcriptions of the several witnesses of a complex textual
                    tradition into a sort of "logical sum." [Ta,56]
                The difference between encoding a running text representation and relating its
                    relevant segments to an external knowledge representation organized as a
                    database [Ta,55-57] can be related to the distinction between the form of the
                    expression and the form of the content. But in many cases the form of the
                    exppression reveals a structural feature of its content. That is why this
                    distinction is easily overlooked. What is then the conceptual status of markup?
                    Is it a sort of metalinguistic description, or is it a direct expansion of our
                    writing system employed to express intrinsic features of textual content? In the
                    latter case markup is to be thought of as an extension of text representation,
                    in the former as a separate and external representation of its structure.
                This question has far-reaching implications, bearing as it does upon the capacity
                    of language to be self-reflexive, but more significantly here it concerns
                    directly the status of markup as a formal language and a document grammar.
