                    Background
                    In this paper, we will be concerned with the study of second language (L2)
                        linguistic creativity as it manifests itself on the lexical level,
                        particularly with respect to word formation. More specifically, we want to
                        measure the extent to which anglophone learners of French of varying degrees
                        of experience are capable of judging the relative productivity of different
                        suffixes, and how this performance compares to that of native speakers.
                    The measures of productivity of word-formation devices which have been used
                        to date, such as lexicographical data (Dubois 1962) and corpus data (Baayen
                        and Renouf 1996, Baayen and Lieber 1991) do not lend themselves well to the
                        study of L2 productivity. Among other things, L2 corpora show relatively
                        small amounts of productivity (Lessard, Levison, Maher and Tomek 1994,
                        Boeder et alii 1993). Despite issues of reliability and interpretation (see
                        Birdsong 1989, Gass 1994, Coppetiers 1987), elicitation appears to offer a
                        potentially useful measure.
                    However, to our knowledge, little research has been done on elicitation to
                        test lexical productivity in French, particularly among L2 learners. Hawkins
                        (1985) forms one exception, but he was concerned primarily with the class of
                        past participle markers, which are at the borderline of affixation and
                        derivation.
                    The research described here draws upon and extends previous work on native
                        speaker judgements of lexical productivity, including Aronoff and
                        Schvaneveldt 1978, Gorska 1982, Anshen and Aronoff 1991, Levison and
                        Lessard, 1995a, Fowler and Liberman 1995 and Keane and Costello 1997. It
                        should be noted however that very little previous work used a computational
                        environment, whereas this is central to the work presented here, and is
                        based on the VINCI natural language generation environment.
                
                
                    Experiments and results
                    The results discussed in the paper represent the third of three stages. 
                    In the first, judgements of acceptability were elicited from native speakers
                        of French for derived forms in -able, -age, -ment, -tion and -ure. In a
                        nutshell, a French lexicon sorted by frequency was used to provide verbs of
                        the first conjugation. Suffixes were added automatically, and at random. A
                        randomized subset of the resulting derived forms was presented to each
                        subject, along with the base form of each verb. Subjects were required to
                        identify which verbs were known to them (almost all, in the case of the
                        native speakers) and which derived forms they found acceptable. Results
                        defined a continuum of relative acceptability with -able at the top of the list, followed by -age, -ment, -tion and -ure in that order. It is
                        important to note that the variable being measured was neither the
                        correctness of the judgements (whether an existing derived form corresponded
                        to those seen as acceptable) nor the individual lexical items, but rather
                        the ranking of suffixes in terms of the number of derived forms they were
                        seen to be capable of producing.
                    In the second stage, the same protocol was applied to non-native speakers
                        ranging from some with high school training in French to some with
                        significant university level studies in French. Results of these tests
                        showed that as knowledge of verb bases decreased, non-native speakers showed
                        increasing discrepancy in their judgements with respect to native speaker
                        rankings.
                    The third stage addressed problems found in the second: the absence of an
                        external measure on which to rank the linguistic skills of the subjects
                        tested, and the relatively high level of linguistic competence of almost all
                        the subjects tested. In response to these problems, the experiment was
                        repeated using the same protocols. Subjects tested were students in oral
                        French classes at Queen's University. Five levels were represented, ranging
                        from 016 to 320, where 016 represented those with essentially no previous
                        knowledge of French, while 320 represented those with near-native
                        proficiency. Placement in these classes had been done on the basis of an
                        oral interview.
                    As an illustration, the results for three of the five suffixes are reproduced
                        in the following table. In the table, the columns suffix ok and suffix not ok
                        represent the average of all responses for each class on the basis of 20
                        questions. In principle, each row should sum to 20, however because some
                        students responded to less than 20 questions, some small variations are
                        found. Verb known and verb
                            not known represent subjects' claimed knowledge of the base
                        verb.

                    The table shows that in all cases, the number of base verbs known rises with
                        level, suggesting that knowledge of verbal base and placement interview
                        results are measuring comparable things. As well, bearing in mind that the
                        acceptance rates by native speakers for derived forms based on -able, -ment and -ure were 77%, 39% and 10% respectively, we see in
                        the non-native speaker data a gradual convergence on native speaker-like
                        judgements. Thus, in the case of -able, while
                        016 students find little to choose between accepting of rejecting derived
                        forms for verbs they know (2 acceptances and 2.25 rejections) and reject
                        strongly derived forms for verbs they don't know (2.75 acceptances versus
                        12.75 rejections), more advanced students tend to accept derived forms for
                        verbs they know (in the case of 219, 9.4 acceptances versus 4 rejections)
                        while rejecting somewhat derived forms in -able
                        for verbs they don't know.
                
                
                    Conclusions and future directions
                    This data hides considerable variation which will be elaborated during the
                        presentation. However, it confirms that the measure is robust, even with
                        students with relatively lower skill levels in French. In the paper, more
                        detailed analyses will be presented. As well, an extended range of measuring
                        instruments will be discussed, based on contextualizing examples to be
                        evaluated in a sentence generated on the fly, other types of measures (see
                        Feldman 1995 for examples) and scales (see Bard, Robertson and Sorace
                        1996).
