                    This session will consist of four papers which will look in some depth at the
                        humanities computing training, teaching, support and development services
                        which are taking place at the University of Oxford, with the overarching
                        theme of initiating activity, innovating to keep up with changing trends,
                        and collaborating with academic faculties to our mutual advantage.
                        Applications of Information Technology in humanities subjects at Oxford
                        University go back to the early seventies. Over the last two decades we have
                        arrived at a structure, which, we hope, maximises the usefulness of
                        computing technologies within the Humanities faculties at our University.
                        Oxford University has dispersed, widely distributed, de-centralised
                        computing facilities and many networks: college networks, faculty networks,
                        departmental networks and library networks. We provide a central place to
                        explain to humanities scholars the opportunities which IT can provide and
                        help them to make computers a tool of their own.
                    The first two papers will present an interesting contrast of the
                        complementary services provided by the main training and support section of
                        the Humanities Computing Unit, the Centre for Humanities Computing (CHC),
                        and the newest addition to the HCU's activities, the Humanities Computing
                        Development Team (HCDT). The second two papers describe in detail three of
                        the collaborative teaching and research projects which the HCU has worked
                        upon during the academic year 1998-9.

                                Introductory Summary
                                The Centre for Humanities Computing, one of the components of
                                    Humanities Computing Unit at Oxford University Computing
                                    Services was one of the earliest centres of its kind in the
                                    academic world and has grown organically in response to the
                                    needs of its users and relevant developments in Information
                                    Technology.
                                This paper describes the model developed by the Centre for
                                    Humanities Computing, for working with humanities scholars in
                                    applying Information Technology in their studies and research.
                                
                            
                            
                                Background
                                The Centre for Humanities Computing has had a long experience of
                                    teaching IT skills. In the past 8 years, the Centre for
                                    Humanities Computing has developed introductory all-day
                                    workshops for the Humanities scholars. However, the mushrooming
                                    of techniques and resources is continuously forcing the unit to
                                    evaluate, change and refine the methods of teaching Information
                                    Technology to humanities scholars. We are now creating
                                    subject-specific courses to enable scholars to understand fully
                                    what is available to them electronically in order to enhance
                                    their work.
                            
                            
                                Modules Taught
                                1.) Current Teaching Programme
                                Our teaching is structured as far as possible to reflect
                                    different abilities or amounts of knowledge in Information
                                    Technology. This is accomplished on two levels:
                                        Through a questionnaire before the start of each
                                            course to ascertain the student's level of Information
                                            Technology competence
                                        Through an evaluation form at the end of every course
                                            to find out how useful the courses have been and what
                                            the participants got out of it.
                                    
                                Both these forms enable us to fine tune the courses better and
                                    match them to the needs of the participants.
                                Our teaching programme is divided into the following
                                        modules:
                                        Induction Talks to Humanities Faculties (Introductory

                                We will also consider briefly the two other major centres for
                                    Humanities Computing in the UK: Glasgow University and King's
                                    College, London. We will compare and contrast the way they
                                    structure their courses with what is being offered at the Centre
                                    for Humanities Computing at Humanities Computing Unit.
                            
                            
                                Strategies for Publicizing and Marketing our Services
                                We reach scholars through our workshops, the Humanities Computing
                                    in Oxford Newsletter, seminars with invited speakers, the
                                    Humanities Computing Unit web pages, and our face-to-face
                                    on-demand advisory services.
                                If we are to be of real benefit to humanities scholars, we have
                                    to keep upgrading our own skills. This is a pressing and
                                    permanent factor in our work. Every year more and more students
                                    come to us who are already knowledgeable about Information
                                    Technology. We have to keep up with the changes in the level of
                                    expertise we have to offer, from those who are already
                                    relatively computer literate to those who do not have the
                                    rudiments of using a keyboard.
                                Since the Dearing Report,1. The
                                            Dearing Report, or the Report of the Commission
                                            Enquiring into the State of UK Higher Education,
                                        was produced by a UK government initiative and published
                                        in1998. Information Technology training is
                                    increasingly seen as an indispensable part of graduate and
                                    indeed undergraduate training. Our Unit is well placed to
                                    monitor this field and keep its skills and training programmes
                                    up to date. A major aspect of our services and a major point in
                                    our mission is to offer humanities scholars continuity from year
                                    to year.
                            
                            
                                Conclusion
                                We are developing increasingly sophisticated courses at the
                                    Centre for Humanities Computing and we will explain the changes
                                    which we are currently making with an historical overview of the
                                    past situation. Courses for different faculties can have a
                                    common core, but we also need to customise courses for each
                                    faculty's needs. This is initially time-consuming but it is
                                    always challenging work. We have to consult with members of
                                    different faculties and their IT committees. Overall, we must be
                                    sympathetic to a wide range of disciplines and their
                                    requirements and work together with them in mutual support.

                        Sarah Porter
                        
                            
                                Oxford University's Humanities Computing Unit has recently added
                                    a formal development component to its activities in Humanities
                                    Computing. The Humanities Computing Development Team works in
                                    innovative partnerships with members of the humanities faculties
                                    to develop new teaching and research resources for use both
                                    within and without the University. This is a new approach to the
                                    integration of IT into the University's activities and one which
                                    presents interesting and very particular challenges to the
                                    working process of the staff of the HCU, and expects a great
                                    deal of flexible working on the part of the academic staff. This
                                    paper outlines the background to the new Team, the needs within
                                    the University that it aims to meet, reports on the major issues
                                    which have emerged in its first nine months of operation, and
                                    makes some recommendations for the future.
                            
                            
                                Background
                                In parallel with its support, training and information
                                    dissemination activities which have been described by Grazyna
                                    Cooper, the Humanities Computing Unit also has a history of
                                    cutting-edge development activities; most recently this has
                                    included the Virtual Seminars for Teaching Literature Project
                                    (Lee, 1998). These projects have all had successful outcomes and
                                    produced academically-rigorous research and teaching materials
                                    which have been much used. However, these projects have occurred
                                    on an ad-hoc basis and according to the particular research
                                    interests of the HCU, but have generally had little involvement
                                    from the other departments and faculties of the university, and
                                    thus have impacted little upon the teaching and research
                                    activities.
                                It can seem ironic that whilst the HCU contains centres of
                                    national and international expertise in the use of technology
                                    for research and teaching, these centres have had only a limited
                                    impact on the University itself. Whilst the OTA, CTI Centre and
                                    CHC can offer advice and direction to those with an interest in
                                    implementing IT into their teaching or research, they do not
                                    have the resources to carry out this implementation, or to
                                    employ additional staff for short-term development projects.
                                    Funding from IT components of grants has often gone to
                                    specialists outside the university. It was therefore proposed
                                    that a new element should be added to the existing work of the
                                    HCU, to bring together the expertise of grant-funded components
                                    like the Oxford Text Archive and the Computers in Teaching
                                    Initiative Centre and the local expertise of the Centre for
                                    Humanities Computing, with project-based development.
                            
                            
                                Other Initiatives
                                Many other institutions have already encouraged a higher level of
                                    IT integration into research and teaching with the provision of
                                    centralised group of dedicated staff who are responsible for
                                    specialist technical advice and development activities. These
                                    include the Technology and Teaching Initiative at the University
                                    of Virginia; the Education Technology Services at Penn State
                                    University; Brown University's Scholarly Technology Group, and
                                    McMaster University's Humanities Computing Centre amongst
                                    others. These initiatives operate on various levels of formal
                                    collaboration and different funding models, each of which has
                                    experience to offer to a new venture such as that which we
                                    proposed. 
                            
                            
                                Survey of IT Activity in the Humanities
                                Oxford University is rich in primary and secondary resources, and
                                    in high levels of scholarly activity in research and teaching.
                                    In digital resource development and use there are also pockets
                                    of intensive activity but the idiosyncratic and highly
                                    distributed structure of the University means that this activity
                                    is not communicated or disseminated as much as it could be,
                                    particularly in the humanities where teaching tends to be
                                    located within colleges rather than faculties. The University
                                    Computing Services decided to explore how much current activity
                                    there was by carrying out a paper-based survey of the two
                                    thousand humanities staff in February 1998. The survey asked the
                                    staff to present their views and experiences of using of IT in
                                    research and teaching.
                                146 valid questionnaires were returned and provided some
                                    interesting results. 95 per cent of those staff are currently
                                    using IT in their research, and 56 per cent are currently using
                                    IT as part of their undergraduate teaching. Responses indicated
                                    that most respondents would like to expand their current IT use
                                    into new areas, but this is not currently possible due to lack
                                    of time (cited by over 90 per cent) and training (cited by over
                                    60 per cent). The activities of the CHC are clearly much needed,
                                    despite the last seven years of successful training events.
                            
                            
                                A Humanities Computing Development Team
                                The second section of the survey dealt with a proposal that a
                                    Humanities Computing Development Team (HCDT) should be set up.
                                    This suggestion came about because of a lack which has long been
                                    perceived within the HCU. All the ingredients for successful
                                    IT-based humanities projects are present in Oxford: dedicated
                                    staff; high-quality collections of resources; expertise.
                                    However, the lack of collaboration between individual academics,
                                    faculties and the centres of expertise such as the HCU have
                                    meant that high-level activity is not as widespread as it could
                                    be. The HCDT should be able to work more closely, and for longer
                                    periods of time, with Oxford academic staff in the development
                                    of collaborative projects where academic content should be
                                    selected and created by the academic partner, and decisions
                                    about the technical structure of the project should be made by
                                    the HCDT. This model drew upon similar programmes in a number of
                                    institutions as described above, but in particular sought advice
                                    from the University of Virginia's Technology and Teaching
                                    Initiative (Thomas, 1997).
                                Collaborative academic activities are traditionally not
                                    widespread within the humanities and this is as true at Oxford
                                    as anywhere else. We were unsure how positive the response would
                                    be that academics should play a part in these highly
                                    collaborative ventures. It was a pleasant surprise, therefore,
                                    that 65 per cent of respondents indicated that they would be
                                    willing to work on a collaborative project with the HCDT in the
                                    future and, in fact, 45 projects were suggested for development.
                                    The scope of these projects ranged enormously in detail and in
                                    ambition, from a simple 'put course materials and reading lists
                                    onto the Web' to complex three-dimensional simulations of
                                    archaeological data, over a space and time continuum. They also
                                    crossed the broad spectrum of humanities faculties which the HCU
                                    aims to serve: modern languages, English language and
                                    literature, history, archaeology, classics, philosophy, but also
                                    law, environmental studies, and anthropology.
                            
                            
                                Projects for 1998-9
                                The positive responses were sufficient to convince the Computing
                                    Services that the HCDT would provide a much needed service, and
                                    funds were allocated to a Team for one year, with plans to begin
                                    operation in autumn 1998. We now had to confront the issue of
                                    convincing academic staff that the initiation of a collaborative
                                    project with the HCDT would be a good use of their (limited)
                                    time. A formal call for project proposals was issued with a
                                    comprehensive project application form, and resulted in twelve
                                    complete project proposals from which the first round of
                                    projects were selected. The project selection was carried out in
                                    consultation with the University's Committee for Computing in
                                    the Arts (CCA), which oversees the activities of the HCU. The
                                    committee is made up of eleven representatives from the
                                    University arts and humanities faculties and thus plays a
                                    valuable role as a bridge between the HCU, the faculties and the
                                    University's high-level IT committee. Selection was based on a
                                    number of factors: potential breadth of use; commitment to the
                                    project; realistic and well thought-out goals; and a 'start-up'
                                    factor of how quickly work could begin upon the project. From
                                    these, four projects were selected and have run from October
                                    1998 to March 1999.
                            
                            
                                Lessons Learned During 1998-9
                                Issues which have emerged so far have been the question of
                                    continued funding of our activities; the conflict between the
                                    research and teaching interests of individual academics, and the
                                    faculty committees to whom they report; the lack of experience
                                    in building IT development costs into research grant
                                    applications; the ongoing support and upgrading of IT-based
                                    services; the distribution of labour involved in an IT project
                                    between academic content, design and development. These issues
                                    will be evaluated at the end of the first six months of
                                    operation (in March 1999) and will be discussed in some depth in
                                    this paper.

                                    the Ridgeway' project, online learning materials for Chinese,
                                    and the Theology faculty digital library project. These projects
                                    presented very different technical and pedagogic challenges
                                    which will be discussed in this paper. Crucially, the three
                                    projects also required us to be work within three different
                                    'constellations' of project partners, consisting of HCDT -
                                    academic - faculty - other partners which shaped the demands and
                                    pressures of the projects.
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                    
                        The Hillforts of the Ridgeway Project
                        Peter Karas
                        
                            Oxford's Institute of Archaeology tries to involve its undergraduates
                                as much as possible in 'real life' archaeology. Each student takes
                                part in on site digs at the Hillforts site in their first year. Each
                                new site is dug by succesive generations of students. This allows
                                novice archaeologists to focus their skills whilst in the longer
                                term a picture of the ancient landscape of the Ridgeway area
                                emerges. Lifelong learning students from the University's School of
                                Continuing Education work with the undergraduates to work towards
                                both academic and professional qualifications.
                            There is a long tradition of the use of databases in archaeology, a
                                result of the need to catalogue and analyse large bodies of complex
                                data. However often, the use and manipulation of the data is the
                                reserve of research staff, and students are seen more as data entry
                                staff in a second stage of 'on site' recording.
                            The Ridgeway database differentiates itself from this norm in that
                                the project was devised with both teaching and research needs in
                                mind.
                            The aims of the Database project are twofold.
                                    To aid in the analysis of recorded materials. A flexible
                                        database allows for powerful exploration of field data. Such
                                        data exploration is the culmination and ultimately the
                                        purpose of excavation.
                                    To train students in the practice of on site recording and
                                        in the use of databases.
                                
                            This dual purpose is reflected in the collaboration of the HCDT with
                                staff from the department of continuing education and the
                                archaeology department. The choice of a popular relational database
                                management system allows students to train with a vocationally
                                valuable tool and allow the flexibility of analysis desired by
                                Research staff. To cater for this multiple functions of the database
                                a number of graphical interfaces have been designed, ensuring ease
                                of use by both novice and advanced users. Development has focussed
                                around a series of prototypes allowing constructive feedback form
                                users. Other issues include the development of an easily
                                maintainable help system and tools to customise the database.
                            In its first phase, the database has been networked within Oxford to
                                allow the addition of records to the database by staff and students.
                                In its second phase, the database will form the centre of a web site
                                dedicated to the Ridgeway Project, which will provide background to
                                the site and give guided, step-by-step instruction to the use of the
                                database by external users.
                            The project has been a unique experience in the way that it has
                                relied upon the close cooperation of a number of very different
                                parts of the university, to their mutual benefit. Training and
                                teaching expertise provided by the Centre for Continuing Education,
                                and academic rigour by the Institute of Archaeology. Through a
                                process of constant feedback and revision of design a tool which is
                                usable on a number of levels has been created.
                            The Chinese Institute web site project involves the collaboration of
                                HCDT staff with the Centre for learning Chinese as a foreign
                                language. The Centre for learning Chinese is a new initiative within
                                the faculty of Oriental studies, which was set up to provide a focus
                                for excellence in the teaching of Chinese. The projects main aim is
                                to deliver teaching materials which have been developed in a closed
                                environment over the internet. The first step involves the
                                development of a core of digital graphical and textual information
                                under guidelines set out by the HCDT. This archive of material is
                                then reused in several interactive teaching applications, delivered
                                over the internet. Eventually users progress through tutorials will
                                be monitored, allowing the teacher to build a profile of each
                                student's online activity.
                            The areas of study have been carefully selected to make best use of
                                the technology, for tasks which will benefit most from its use. We
                                have been given strong pedagogic direction by the academic partner
                                who has made thoughtful decisions about when technology has a place,
                                and when it does not. Our first exercises are a good example of this
                                approach: undergraduates who study Chinese frequently study ab
                                initio and therefore need to work intensively to acquire a good
                                level of familiarity with the Chinese character set. Learning the
                                stroke order for the characters is an essential part of
                                understanding the characters, but this is boring and difficult when
                                done from paper. Use of animated characters in interactive exercises
                                allows the student to practice in a more flexible and stimulating
                                environment.
                            The use of the internet to deliver such materials have important
                                implications for student access both within the university where
                                students have free access to networked terminals within colleges and
                                for distance learning. The ability for students with disabilities
                                which might otherwise affect their attendance in class, to hand in
                                coursework at times more suited to their needs is also an attractive
                                facet of the project.
                            As in the case of all computer application development the most
                                challenging aspects of the work have been consolidating the academic
                                partners with realistic technical goals. This can only be achieved
                                with close contact and a mutual understanding and respect. The HCDT
                                method encourages selection of such working partners and projects
                                have proven to be a success for this reason.

                                This paper explores a small-scale, but influential library
                                    digitisation project undertaken by Oxford's newly-established
                                    Humanities Computing Development Team. Topics covered include: a
                                    general background to the project; its objectives (for the
                                    library and faculty concerned, for the HCDT, and for the
                                    university as a whole); the choices made over which material to
                                    digitise; and a discussion of the technology selected (and / or
                                    rejected) for the project.
                            
                            
                                Background
                                Following a proposal by Susan Lake, of Oxford University's
                                    Theology Faculty Library, for a medium-scale digitisation
                                    project (circa 8000 pages of text), the HCDT was asked to carry
                                    out a pilot project (for c.700 pages of text). To maximise the
                                    benefits of digitisation, the material digitised comprises
                                    out-of-print monographs, off-prints of high-demand chapters in
                                    books, and articles in journals - all from core Theology reading
                                    lists. 
                            
                            
                                Aims
                                The objectives of the full project are: to enhance the Teaching
                                    and Research capabilities of the Theology Faculty, to relieve
                                    space and staff pressures within the faculty Library, and to
                                    provide enhanced forms of learning.
                                It is anticipated that the main use of the online texts, will be
                                    simply for students to print them out and use them at their
                                    leisure. However, the texts will also be searchable, not just
                                    the bibliographic information (as in the online library
                                    catalogue), but the texts themselves, making resource discovery
                                    much easier. Moreover, since there is no practical limit to the
                                    number of copies of a text in circulation, no student or
                                    researcher will be denied access because that text is "out". 
                                Whilst many of the books to be digitised will no doubt be
                                    retained in the main part of the Theology Faculty Library, it is
                                    hoped that digitisation will allow much of the other paper
                                    material (mainly old runs of journals) to be moved elsewhere,
                                    freeing up space for new acquisitions.
                                Perhaps most importantly, the project can also be seen as a case
                                    study for digital library projects in a wider context within
                                    Oxford, particularly in the light of the aims of the study
                                    'Scoping the Future of Oxford's Digital Collections'2. Information about the Scoping
                                            Oxford's Digital Collections study is available
                                        from &lt;&gt; or by contacting Stuart Lee at the University of
                                        Oxford. which aims, amongst other things to: 
                                        document, analyse and evaluate Oxford's current
                                            digitization activities, as a basis for assessing the
                                            effectiveness of the various methodologies used;
                                        investigate the possibilities for building on the
                                            existing project-based work and for migrating it into
                                            viable services for library users;
                                    
                                Thus is can be seen that, despite the initial modest objectives
                                    of the HCDT pilot, the project may be quite influential. It
                                    explores some of the issues of the main study on a small scale,
                                    and investigates factors not just from a library professional's
                                    perspective, but also from IT skills, academic, and funding
                                    perspectives.
                            
                            
                                Pilot Content
                                In order to make the HCDT's pilot project of some practical use
                                    for teaching (as well as establishing the foundations of the
                                    full project), it was suggested by Jeremy Duff who teaches
                                    within the Theology faculty that the project should concentrate
                                    on the reading list for one paper. The paper chosen, Mark, was picked for a number of
                                        reasons.
                                        most first-years take the Mark paper, therefore there is a high demand
                                            for these texts
                                        there is a well-defined core to the paper, making it
                                            possible to isolate key texts
                                        most college tutors have responsibility for some
                                            students taking Mark,
                                            leading to a wide impact within the faculty
                                        Jeremy Duff teaches Mark,
                                            and is prepared to take responsibility for coordinating
                                            the academic parts of the project
                                    
                            
                            
                                Technology
                                From a technical point of view, the project is concerned with the
                                    following issues:
                                        Digitisation and optical character recognition of the
                                            texts concerned
                                        Evaluation of the pros and cons of a variety of
                                            delivery and indexing systems; XML\SGML; Adobe Acrobat;
                                            non-proprietary image systems, etc.
                                        Implementation, testing, and final evaluation (based
                                            on feedback from its use in teaching) of one such system
                                            for the pilot project
                                        Support for Classical Greek (and to a lesser extent
                                            Hebrew) character sets over the World Wide Web, for
                                            example through the use of Dynamic Font technology 
                                        Integration with the University wide online library
                                            catalog, OLIS 
                                    
                            
                            
                                Conclusion and Impact
                                It can be seen that the project is a partnership between the
                                    HCDT, the Theology Faculty Library, and Theology Faculty
                                    academics, each party contributing their own expertise and
                                    resources.
                                The pilot system will be used by first-year undergraduates during
                                    the 1999 Michaelmas term. The project will report back on its
                                    technical and other findings, and so feed into other similar
                                    projects as well as the Scoping the
                                        Future survey which may be considered by other
                                    faculties. 
                            
                            
                                HCDT: the Future
                                The most crucial issue which is under current consideration is
                                    the future operation of the HCDT and the closely connected issue
                                    of its future funding. These issues have already been hotly
                                    debated and are still far from being resolved. The Committee for
                                    Computing in the Arts has indicated that it strongly believes
                                    the HCDT should continue to be funded centrally by the
                                    University, so that the Team can continue to select projects on
                                    a merit basis rather than with financial backing. However, is it
                                    appropriate that expert development services should be provided
                                    to academics without any financial contribution being made by
                                    that project or individual? Are we genuinely carrying out
                                    collaborative activities with benefits for each partner, or is
                                    one partner providing a service for another? These issues not
                                    only impact upon the services within Oxford but have
                                    implications for the future of humanities computing in a wider
                                    sphere, and as such will be given careful consideration.
