                This poster presents results of research on popular romance and detective
                    fiction. The predictability of these stories resembles the oral storytelling
                    tradition, i.e. a story already familiar to its readers is being retold over and
                    over again (Radway 1984:198). The reader is not left in suspense of the final
                    outcome of the story; it is the events leading up to it which make each story
                    different. Through these events the reader becomes involved in the emotional
                    life of the romantic heroine or deliberates with the detective over the various
                    clues to the case.
                This poster examines how the reader is made privy to emotions, attitudes and
                    thoughts of the protagonist by looking at markers of stance in three types of
                    romantic novels and two types of detective stories. These markers include
                    syntactic and semantic features that express the protagonist's feelings,
                    emotions, moods, etc. Principal components analysis was used to reduce the 12
                    markers of stance to two dimensions. The results are then compared with Biber
                    and Finegan's (1989) analysis of stance across various text types.
