                Assessing the value of any technology-based approach to education and training
                    requires an understanding of objectives, methods, and expected outcomes. For
                    this reason we discuss with institutions the use of tools in the context of
                    educational issues and their attendant methodologies. Our approach to the use of
                    IT is based on the following observations:
                        Tools need to be designed with educators and students in mind.
                        Solutions must be scalable, that is, capable of being implemented in a
                            realistic educational context.
