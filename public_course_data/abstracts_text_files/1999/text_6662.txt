                    The success of SGML is based in part on the natural way in which SGML
                        documents can be regarded as linearizations of trees using a notation
                        essentially similar to labeled bracketing, and on the natural way in which
                        the tree so represented can be interpreted as a parse tree or an abstract
                        syntax tree for the grammar defined in the documents' document type
                        definition (DTD). The close ties among grammar, tree structure, and
                        linearization give SGML an intellectual coherence missing from some other
                        markup schemes.
                    When it comes to overlapping structures, however, these notions cannot be
                        applied with the same naturalness.
                    Therefore, a major challenge to any attempt to provide better support for
                        markup of overlap is to provide not only a convenient file format for
                        recording overlap, but also a notation for expressing constraints on
                        documents with overlap, and plausible data structures for representing
                        documents with overlap. In this paper we address the third of these
                        problems.
                
                
                    The GODDAG Structure
                    Consider the following simple example of a document with overlapping structures:
                        &lt;s/&lt;a/ John &lt;b/ likes /a&gt; Mary /b&gt;/s&gt;
                    The sentence John likes Mary is tagged as a sentence (s). The words John likes are tagged as an a, and the words likes Mary as a
                            b. Because the a
                        and the b overlap, the document has no
                        convenient representation in SGML, and no SGML-style tree can be drawn for
                        it.
                    However, we can draw the containment relations among s, a, b, and the words
                        of the text in a natural way. The result is a graph like this: 
                    The graph resembles a tree, but differs from a tree in that multiple parent
                        nodes can contain the same child. The multiple parents of such a child are
                        the elements which overlap in the original document; the child is the scope
                        of the overlap. For our purposes, overlap is simply multiple parentage.
                    Graphs like the one just shown may be constructed for any document with
                        overlapping structures. If a document has no overlaps, the graph reduces to
                        a tree. If a document does have overlap, the corresponding graph will
                        preserve as many of the characteristics of the document tree as
                        possible.
                    Because the structure described is an acyclic directed graph in which nodes
                        have ordered descendants, we refer to it as a General Ordered-Descendant
                        Directed Acyclic Graph (GODDAG).
                    
                        Interpretation
                        The GODDAG structure allows the markup in the source document to be
                            interpreted in fairly straightforward graph-theoretical terms. The
                            inheritance from parents to children of claims about properties can be
                            interpreted just as it can be for a tree structure.
                        Since elements can have multiple parents, however, rules for multiple
                            inheritance must be developed by the application or document type
                            definition. Just as with trees, GODDAG structures provide simple ways to
                            explain and think about overriding of inherited values and the
                            coexistence of properties asserted of ancestors and descendants.
                        The rules of interpretation become more complex than those of standard
                            SGML, precisely because the GODDAG structure is more complex than a
                            tree.
                    
                    
                        Spurious overlap
                        When two elements overlap, they define three distinct regions dominated
                            by one or the other of the overlapping elements, or both:
                            &lt;a/ John &lt;b/ likes /a&gt; Mary /b&gt;
                        If any one of the regions is empty, then the overlap is spurious: the
                            document can be rewritten without overlap, without changing the
                            interpretation of any character of the document:
                            &lt;a/ &lt;b/ likes /a&gt; Mary /b&gt;
                            &lt;a/ John &lt;b//a&gt; Mary /b&gt;
                            &lt;a/ John &lt;b/ likes /a&gt; /b&gt;
                        We define the function leafset as returning
                            the set of leaf nodes dominated by a given non-leaf node. A GODDAG
                            structure is clean (lacks spurious overlap) if the following conditions
                                hold:
                                If leafset(b) is a proper subset
                                    of leafset(a), then a path of
                                    parent-child arcs from a to b exists.
                                If leafset (b) is equal to leafset(a), then either an arc from
                                        a to b exists or an arc from b to a exists.
                            
                    
                    
                        Applications
                        The major expected applications of the GODDAG structure include:
                                conditional indexing and processing
                                extraction of well-formed subtrees and subdocuments from MECS
                                    documents
                                removal of spurious overlap from MECS documents and HTML
                                    documents
                            
                        Possible extensions include:
                                graphs with disordered nodes
                                graphs representing multiple orderings of data

                Everything we say about SGML in this paper applies to XML as well. For
                    overviews of overlap-related problems, see Barnard et al. 1988, Barnard et al.

                    1995, and chapter 31 of the TEI Guidelines. The optional CONCUR feature, which
                    does allow for multiple concurrent hierarchies in SGML documents, is discussed
                    in Sperberg-McQueen and Huitfeldt 1998.
