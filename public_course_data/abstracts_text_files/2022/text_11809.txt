Administering oneâ€™s own server rather than relying on managed web hosting empowers researchers, teachers, and students by providing them with complete control over their web assets. The resulting setup can be used for webapps, static sites like Jekyll and Hugo, or more robust sites like WordPress, Omeka, Scalar, and Drupal. These will be ready for use with domain names. In addition to providing an entry point to the web, servers can also enable teams of researchers and students to collaborate on programming projects or access shared data.
