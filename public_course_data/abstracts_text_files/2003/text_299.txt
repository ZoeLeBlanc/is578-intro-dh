                This paper will present the results of work being done at UNC Chapel Hill to
                    support the emerging EpiDoc standard for encoding epigraphic texts. The EpiDoc
                    standard is based on the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines (). Information on this collaborative effort,
                    which includes scholars and humanities computing experts from North America and
                    Europe, is available at . The
                    mission of the project is to develop "a software and hardware-independent
                    interchange specification for scholarly and educational editions of inscribed
                    and incised texts in Greek, Latin and other languages emanating from the ancient
                    Greek, Roman and nearby civilizations." The Chapel Hill team has focused on
                    building tools to facilitate epigraphers' work on creating EpiDoc texts and
                    managing the storage and presentation of those texts. The paper will begin with
                    a brief outline of the EpiDoc guidelines with examples of their implementation
                    and a discussion of some of the problems inherent in digital epigraphy. Then the
                    various tools developed by the Chapel Hill team will be demonstrated.
                The editing and publication of inscribed documents has a rich history, which
                    includes the adoption of widely accepted standards for "marking up" texts.
                    Published Greek and Latin epigraphic texts are almost universally presented
                    according to the "Leiden convention,"developed in 1931 at the 18th International
                    Congress of Orientalists by papyrologists. The Leiden convention employs various
                    symbols to present information about the condition of the inscribed text and
                    editorial supplements and comments. For example, parentheses surround editorial
                    expansions of abbreviated words, so "AVG" on the support would be expanded as
                    "Aug(ustus)" by the editor. In EpiDoc, the same text would be written
                    "Aug&lt;expan&gt;ustus&lt;/expan&gt;." Because of the widespread
                    adoption of the Leiden convention, the form of published texts (allowing for
                    some local variations) is remarkably consistent. Because of this consistency, it
                    is possible to write a parser that can translate a digitized inscription into a
                    data structure (such as XML). The Chapel Hill team has developed such a parser,
                    named the Chapel Hill Epigraphic Text Converter (CHET-C). This tool parses texts
                    marked up according to the Leiden convention and outputs EpiDoc XML. Both MS
                    Access and Java versions are being developed.
                Digital texts in polytonic Greek pose problems of their own because of the
                    various methods which evolved to encode them prior to the advent of Unicode. One
                    of the earliest of these was Beta Code, which utilizes 7-bit ASCII to represent
                    Greek, Latin, and Aramaic texts, as well as various epigraphical and
                    papyrological sigla. In addition, a number of Greek fonts, each employing its
                    own specialized encoding, were developed over the years to handle the problem of
                    typing and viewing Greek with computers. There exist already various programs
                    and filters which can handle shifting the encoding of texts from one form to
                    another (the Greek texts on  employ
                    such filters, for example). There was still a need for a more flexible system to
                    handle encoding shifts, however, and so the Chapel Hill team (in collaboration
                    with the Stoa Consortium, ) has developed
                    Java-based software that performs this function and which can easily be plugged
                    into the larger toolkit framework. The transcoder classes can perform encoding
                    shifts on text within specific elements of an XML file, and are also designed to
                    be modular and easily extensible to handle languages other than Ancient
                    Greek.
                The team has also developed a web-based framework for the presentation of EpiDoc
                    texts. The framework has been built with Apache Cocoon () and is hosted by the Stoa. The
                    "Epidocinator" as it is called, can dynamically transform EpiDoc documents
                    against a variety of XSL stylesheets. Both documents and stylesheets may be
                    either on site or remote. The framework will also perform validation and error
                    reporting on EpiDoc texts. The transcoder classes will be accessible via a
                    Cocoon Transformer, so that Greek text can automatically be shifted from any
                    supported source format to any supported result format. It will employ the Java
                    version of CHET-C in a custom Cocoon Generator or Transformer to allow users to
                    generate EpiDocs from already-digitized inscriptions. The framework will be
                    packaged as a Web Archive (WAR), so that interested developers can easily deploy
                    their own digital epigraphy frameworks.
                Finally, the team is also working to integrate the Java tools with jEdit, a
                    Java-based text editor with a very robust plugin architecture (). The goal is essentially to create an
                    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for epigraphers which editors will be
                    able to use in the electronic publication of EpiDoc texts. All of the tools and
                    stylesheets developed for use with EpiDoc will be available as jEdit plugins and
                    editors will also have available jEdit's XML and XSLT plugins, which provide
                    useful functions like code-completion, tag creation help (based on a DTD),
                    validation, error reporting, and transformation. The combination of the web
                    framework and the text editor will provide epigraphers with a cross-platform,
                    Open Source solution for creating and publishing inscriptions.

                All of the tools described above will be demonstrated briefly, using texts marked
                    up by various projects that have adopted the new standard. Then I will conclude
                    by discussing how the EpiDoc Collaborative plans to proceed in developing the
                    standard and the supporting tools. The project's use of open standards and Open
                    Source development tools provides a useful model for similar types of scholarly
                    publication, one which could be picked up and extended for other purposes
                    without a great deal of effort.
