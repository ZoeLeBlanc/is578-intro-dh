                At the beginning of 2001 work started on the Commedia Project, a research effort
                    which will transcribe in full seven manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy in order to collate them and present them in an
                    electronic format. As part of the prolegomena for the Project, we had to write
                    its transcription guidelines, a task that appeared straight forward. However, as
                    often happens, drafting the new guidelines developed into a task with
                    implications beyond its immediate intended use.
                Initially, it was agreed that the Commedia Project transcription guidelines
                    should be based on those of the Società Dantesca for
                    their Dante Online website (). It soon became
                    evident that although the Società Dantesca's
                    guidelines offered the advantage of having taken into consideration practical
                    matters concerning spellings, punctuation, word division and the expansion of
                    abbreviations, they did not deal with many other matters which were required for
                    the Commedia Project. The Società Dantesca uses a form of symbolic
                    representation—based on conventions—to convey the transcribers interpretation of
                    what they believe to be in the manuscripts. For example, the Società Dantesca transcribes (Riccardiana 1005, Inferno, Canto I, 17):
                    &lt;di +i0 del&gt;
                These symbols are used to represent a deletion. In this case, the deletion was
                    carried out by the main scribe of the text—or by an indistinguishable
                    hand—indicated by 0. The complete set of symbols is enclosed in angle brackets.
                    The first word, in this case ‘di’ is the one which was originally in the
                    manuscript, and the last word—‘del’—is the one which replaced it. Next to the
                    0—representing the main hand or one which cannot be distinguished from it—the
                    plus symbol is used—addition—and the letter ‘i’ which indicates that the
                    correction has been introduced between the lines, i.e. it is interlinear. The
                        Società Dantesca guidelines allow the
                    possibility of marginal additions—‘m’—or additions within the line—for which
                    they do not use any symbol. In this specific case, according to the
                    transcription produced by the Società Dantesca, the
                    manuscript has the word ‘di’ which has been substituted by the word ‘del,’
                    creating the phrase ‘del pianeta’ instead of the original reading ‘di
                    pianeta.’
                A second example can be found in Riccardiana 1005, Inferno, Canto I, 94:&lt;crede +i0
                    cride&gt;
                Here, the original reading “crede” is followed by the identifiers for the
                    position and the scribe, and at the end, the modified reading “cride,” again,
                    all enclosed in angle brackets.
                The Società Dantesca system also permits a symbolic
                    representation of marginal additions—[... +m1 o], an addition of the letter ‘o’
                    in the margin, which has been added by a second scribe (here represented by the
                    number 1) to cover a lacuna—, interpolations or cancellations.
                Although these guidelines were useful as a base for the Commedia Project’s
                    transcription system, a new encoding system was required for the encoding of the
                    manuscripts. Other projects in which we are involved used very simple encoding
                    systems. For example, the encoding for the Canterbury Tales Project’s
                    publications uses [add][/add] for additions and [del][/del] for deletions. Thus,
                    an interlinear addition in the Merchant's Tale, line 219 (CTP lineation system)
                    was tagged:tree [add]is[/add] neydir
                However, the verb is not in the same line as the other words, in fact, there is a
                    caret indicating that the word ‘is’ is an addition to the line. Although the
                    Canterbury Tales Project tags were useful when it started, they now seem to lack
                    the flexibility which is required to present certain aspects of a scholarly
                    edition. Given the nature of the corrections in the Commedia manuscripts, the
                    Project required tags that were able to handle situations more complex than
                    those of additions and deletions. One of the main aims of this project is to
                    produce a CD-ROM with seven witnesses of the Commedia
                    which Federico Sanguineti has identified as textually the most important.
                    Sanguineti has already produced a critical edition of Dante’s Commedia, and the research he has already done is still being
                    carried out at the Canterbury Tales Project. For this reason, the Commedia
                    Project has a clearer conviction of which things are important and should be
                    displayed in the CD-ROMs, and what the purposes of its transcriptions are, than
                    the Canterbury Tales Project had when it was officially started in 1993. Because
                    of this, it was possible to develop a encoding system which allows the
                    distinction of different scribal hands or corrections made by the same scribe at
                    different stages.
                Hitherto, the encoding of projects similar to the Commedia Project, such as the
                    Canterbury Tales Project, attempted to present simultaneously both ‘what is in
                    the manuscript’ as a series of additions or deletion, and ‘what is in the text’,
                    as a series of distinct readings. However, after months of discussion with Klaus
                    Wachtel (Institute for New Testament Research, Munster) about the transcription
                    of corrections of the manuscripts of the Greek New Testament, new ideas about
                    how to encode different textual stages started to emerge. These discussions were
                    the base of the encoding system developed for the Commedia Project. The main
                    goal of this new transcription system is to present a clear distinction between
                    what is in the manuscript and how the transcriber interprets the different
                    stages of development of the text.
                The Commedia Project encoding system aims to represent the different stages of
                    variation in the text. When a transcriber finds a ‘place of variation’ in the
                    manuscript, he or she can use the apparatus tag—[app][/app]. (We are using
                    Collate-style encoding in the transcriptions: before publication, these will be
                    translated into XML encoding). The apparatus tag contains three main components:
                    the original reading (contained in the [orig][/orig] tag), the final reading
                    (contained in a tag which specifies which copyist produced this [c1][/c1],
                    [c2][/c2], [c3][/c3]), and what literally is in the manuscript (contained in the
                    [lit][/lit] tag). If there are more than two stages in a correction, for
                    example, in the case of having more than one corrector), these stages are
                    presented in what is likely to be their successive order.
                The following example is taken from Riccardiana 1005, Inferno, Canto III, 9:
                The Commedia Project transcription guidelines indicate that we should transcribe
                    as follows :
                    [app] [orig]dura[/orig] [c1]duro[/c1] [lit]dur[ud]a[/ud]o[/lit]
                    [/app]
                Since the dot below the letter ‘a’ indicates deletion, the transcriber is faced
                    with a place of variation—indicated in the transcription by the apparatus
                    tag—[app][/app]. The first component inside the apparatus tag is the original
                    reading—[orig]dura[/orig]. The second component is the final reading by the main
                    hand, the reading [c1]duro[/c1]. These two components express different states
                    of the text, but do not explain by which process the text change from one to the
                    other. For this purpose we use the literal tag—[lit][/lit]—which indicates what
                    literally is happening in the manuscript, in this case
                    [lit]dur[ud]a[/ud]o[/lit], that is, literally the letters ‘d’ ‘u’ ‘r’ are
                    present, followed by an ‘a’ which has been underdotted and an ‘o.’ In the
                    literal tag, there is less space for interpretation and the transcriber is
                    required to postpone judgment (for example, whether the underdotting of the ‘a’
                    indicates cancellation or not).
                In comparison with the lack of flexibility of the old encoding system of the
                    Canterbury Tales Project, the Commedia Project's guidelines present several
                    advantages. Firstly, the transcribers can defer interpretation of the stages of
                    meaning, since the literal tag can be transcribed independently of the other
                    components of the apparatus tag (this also gives the advantage of allowing the
                    editor of a publication to make a final decision as to what happened at each
                    individual place of variation). Secondly, the contents of the literal tag allows
                    us to reconstruct what actually appears in a manuscript on the computer screen.
                    Thirdly, the other components of the apparatus tag, such as original reading,
                    final reading, and intermediate readings, can be collated separately from the
                    rest of the text. The separate collation of multiple readings in a manuscript
                    will be most useful when a scribe used a manuscript of different affiliation to
                    correct his copy. In such cases, separate collation will allow the isolation of
                    readings which originated in different manuscripts and which could hint at
                    distinct affiliations in a single text. Separate collation might also be of help
                    in cases in which conflation has occurred because a manuscript is corrected with
                    another one from a different branch of a textual tradition.
                The encoding system of the Commedia Project has also been implemented by the
                    Canterbury Tales Project (for publications to appear after the Miller’s Tale on
                    CD-ROM, edited by Peter Robinson and the Nun’s Priest’s Tale on CD-ROM, edited
                    by Paul Thomas) and, in the future, might be also adopted by other projects
                    (notably, transcription of Greek New Testament manuscripts) for their
                    transcriptions. This new encoding system also offers advantages when applied to
                    authorial manuscripts, and although it was originally designed to deal with
                    problems of corrections presented by medieval manuscripts, it should work as
                    efficiently to distinguish different authorial versions of a particular text.
                    This should translate into an easier reconstruction of these authorial versions
                    and allow the distinction and separate reconstruction of different authorial
                    versions.
