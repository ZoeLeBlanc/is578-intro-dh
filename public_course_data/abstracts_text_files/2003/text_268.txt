                    INTRODUCTION:
                    
                        
                            
                                The work’s material history since its
                                    inception, the vast and largely uncharted alterations imposed by
                                    the history and by the mediation of generation upon generation
                                    of printers, editors, publishers—this is a relativism we are
                                    prone to ignore, but ignore at our peril.
                            
                            (Marcus 1996)
                        
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                The literary texts often are not homogenous
                                    since they may comprise dialogues, narrative parts, etc. An
                                    integrated approach, therefore, would require the development of
                                    text sampling tools for selecting the parts of the text that
                                    best illustrate an author’s style.
                            
                            (Stamatatos et al. 2001)
                        
                    
                    Most non-traditional authorship attribution studies place too much emphasis
                        on statistics, stylistics, and the computer and not enough focus is given to
                        the integrity and validity of the primary data— the text itself.
                    It is intuitively obvious and easily shown empirically that if you are
                        conducting a study of the patterns of an author’s stylistic usage (e.g.
                        Daniel Defoe), the study will be systematically denigrated by each
                        interpolation of non-Defoe text and even by each interpolation of Defoe text
                        of a different genre or significantly different time period.
                    The crux of this paper is about one important element in the empirical
                        methodology of a valid non-traditional authorship attribution study—the
                        preparation of the text for stylistic and statistical analysis: unediting,
                        de-editing, and editing.
                    The general emphasis of this presentation is on prose analysis with some
                        peripheral treatment of drama and poetry.
                    
                        I. BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS
                                A. Why a valid text is necessary should not even be asked. No
                                    valid experiment can be done if the input data is flawed—garbage
                                    in, garbage out!Too many practitioners simply grab a text
                                    from any available source—without any thought to its pedigree.
                                    (e.g. Khmelev and Tweedie’s “Using Markov Chains for the
                                    Identification of Writers.”)Are undertakings such as
                                    Project Gutenberg or the Oxford Text Archive with their easily
                                    available machine readable texts a boon or a bane to
                                    non-traditional authorship atudies? This question is explored in
                                    some detail.
                                B. Selecting a starting textThe validity of using texts
                                    from the oral tradition and the scribal tradition is
                                    discussed.Before any manipulation and analysis of a text is
                                    carried out, a valid starting text must be acquired that
                                    fulfills many necessary requirements. This selection is
                                    primarily bibliographically driven. If a practitioner is not
                                    savvy in the bibliographical arts, a collaborator who is should
                                    be recruited.Examples of bad starting texts causing
                                    problems are given (e.g. Peng and Hengartner’s “Quantitative
                                    Analysis of Literary Styles.”)If you cannot obtain a valid
                                    text, do not do the study.

                                    state of “not yet edited”De-editing—removing selected text
                                    Editing—changing (preparing) a text for
                                    statistical analysis
                                
                            
                        II. EXPLICATIONThe statement, “each age, each author, each study
                            demands a different mixture of the following particulars,” is discussed.
                                A. UneditingAs a rule, the closest text to the holograph
                                    should be found and used.

                        IV. CONCLUSION
                                1. Some items that are de-edited are valid style markers in
                                    their own right (e.g. latin phrases, different genre) and should
                                    be treated as such in a parallel study.
                                2. No matter which text is selected, the practitioner must
                                    disclose which text was used and everything that was done to
                                    it.
                                3. The same care must be taken with every text in the
                                    study—the anonymous text, the suspected author’s text, and all
                                    of the control texts.
                                4. If valid texts cannot be located and correctly edited,
                                    unedited, and de-edited, do not do the study
                                5. A valid text does not guarantee a valid study. However, a
                                    non-valid text guarantees a non-valid study.
