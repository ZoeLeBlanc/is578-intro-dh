# All DH Tools Dataset from IS578

# Data Documentation

This dataset is derived from the GitHub Discussion Forum from is578 Introduction to DH Fall 2023. The data was created from unstructured Markdown files that were then transformed into structured rows. The goal of this dataset is to both collect information about DH Tools but also connect it to their use in DH through linking to abstracts from the Index of DH Conferences. The data contains the following properties:

1. `tool_name` which is the main identifier and contains the name of a DH tool
2. `link_tool` which contains a link to the tool’s homepage
3. `abstract_title` which contains that abstract title from the Index of DH Conferences
4. `link_dh_abstract` which contains the link to the abstract
5. `contributor` which lists the individual student who created the original file
6. `description` which lists the tool description (sometimes provided by the student, otherwise by Google)
7. `experience` which lists the experience of the student with the tool (this value is imputed based on answers so it is very subjective)
8. `revised_keywords` which lists my subjective combination of two previous columns to create keywords for each tool
9. `original_submission` which is the link the original GitHub Markdown file
10. `rationale` which contains the student’s rationale for why their submission is considered a DH tool
11. `abstract_original` which notes whether there was an abstract originally linked to the tool or not
12. `alternative_link` which includes a link to a different DH project if an abstract was not located.
